17910,17911,The Statistical Recurrent Unit,"  Sophisticated gated recurrent neural network architectures like LSTMs and
GRUs have been shown to be highly effective in a myriad of applications. We
develop an un-gated unit, the statistical recurrent unit (SRU), that is able to
learn long term dependencies in data by only keeping moving averages of
statistics. The SRU's architecture is simple, un-gated, and contains a
comparable number of parameters to LSTMs; yet, SRUs perform favorably to more
sophisticated LSTM and GRU alternatives, often outperforming one or both in
various tasks. We show the efficacy of SRUs as compared to LSTMs and GRUs in an
unbiased manner by optimizing respective architectures' hyperparameters in a
Bayesian optimization scheme for both synthetic and real-world tasks.

3892,3893,Stochastic population dynamics in spatially extended predator-prey systems,"  Spatially extended population dynamics models that incorporate intrinsic
noise serve as case studies for the role of fluctuations and correlations in
biological systems. Including spatial structure and stochastic noise in
predator-prey competition invalidates the deterministic Lotka-Volterra picture
of neutral population cycles. Stochastic models yield long-lived erratic
population oscillations stemming from a resonant amplification mechanism. In
spatially extended predator-prey systems, one observes noise-stabilized
activity and persistent correlations. Fluctuation-induced renormalizations of
the oscillation parameters can be analyzed perturbatively. The critical
dynamics and the non-equilibrium relaxation kinetics at the predator extinction
threshold are characterized by the directed percolation universality class.
Spatial or environmental variability results in more localized patches which
enhances both species densities. Affixing variable rates to individual
particles and allowing for trait inheritance subject to mutations induces fast
evolutionary dynamics for the rate distributions. Stochastic spatial variants
of cyclic competition with rock-paper-scissors interactions illustrate
connections between population dynamics and evolutionary game theory, and
demonstrate how space can help maintain diversity. In two dimensions,
three-species cyclic competition models of the May-Leonard type are
characterized by the emergence of spiral patterns whose properties are
elucidated by a mapping onto a complex Ginzburg-Landau equation. Extensions to
general food networks can be classified on the mean-field level, which provides
both a fundamental understanding of ensuing cooperativity and emergence of
alliances. Novel space-time patterns emerge as a result of the formation of
competing alliances, such as coarsening domains that each incorporate
rock-paper-scissors competition games.

11720,11721,Merlin-Arthur with efficient quantum Merlin and quantum supremacy for the second level of the Fourier hierarchy,"  We introduce a simple sub-universal quantum computing model, which we call
the Hadamard-classical circuit with one-qubit (HC1Q) model. It consists of a
classical reversible circuit sandwiched by two layers of Hadamard gates, and
therefore it is in the second level of the Fourier hierarchy. We show that
output probability distributions of the HC1Q model cannot be classically
efficiently sampled within a multiplicative error unless the polynomial-time
hierarchy collapses to the second level. The proof technique is different from
those used for previous sub-universal models, such as IQP, Boson Sampling, and
DQC1, and therefore the technique itself might be useful for finding other
sub-universal models that are hard to classically simulate. We also study the
classical verification of quantum computing in the second level of the Fourier
hierarchy. To this end, we define a promise problem, which we call the
probability distribution distinguishability with maximum norm (PDD-Max). It is
a promise problem to decide whether output probability distributions of two
quantum circuits are far apart or close. We show that PDD-Max is BQP-complete,
but if the two circuits are restricted to some types in the second level of the
Fourier hierarchy, such as the HC1Q model or the IQP model, PDD-Max has a
Merlin-Arthur system with quantum polynomial-time Merlin and classical
probabilistic polynomial-time Arthur.

6172,6173,Distribution of the periodic points of the Farey map,"  We expand the cross section of the geodesic flow in the tangent bundle of the
modular surface given by Series to produce another section whose return map
under the geodesic flow is a double cover of the natural extension of the Farey
map. We use this cross section to extend the correspondence between the closed
geodesics on the modular surface and the periodic points of the Gauss map to
include the periodic points of the Farey map. Then, analogous to the work of
Pollicott, we prove an equidistribution result for the periodic points of the
Farey map when they are ordered according to the length of their corresponding
closed geodesics.

8155,8156,Learning model-based planning from scratch,"  Conventional wisdom holds that model-based planning is a powerful approach to
sequential decision-making. It is often very challenging in practice, however,
because while a model can be used to evaluate a plan, it does not prescribe how
to construct a plan. Here we introduce the ""Imagination-based Planner"", the
first model-based, sequential decision-making agent that can learn to
construct, evaluate, and execute plans. Before any action, it can perform a
variable number of imagination steps, which involve proposing an imagined
action and evaluating it with its model-based imagination. All imagined actions
and outcomes are aggregated, iteratively, into a ""plan context"" which
conditions future real and imagined actions. The agent can even decide how to
imagine: testing out alternative imagined actions, chaining sequences of
actions together, or building a more complex ""imagination tree"" by navigating
flexibly among the previously imagined states using a learned policy. And our
agent can learn to plan economically, jointly optimizing for external rewards
and computational costs associated with using its imagination. We show that our
architecture can learn to solve a challenging continuous control problem, and
also learn elaborate planning strategies in a discrete maze-solving task. Our
work opens a new direction toward learning the components of a model-based
planning system and how to use them.

6820,6821,A critical analysis of resampling strategies for the regularized particle filter,"  We analyze the performance of different resampling strategies for the
regularized particle filter regarding parameter estimation. We show in
particular, building on analytical insight obtained in the linear Gaussian
case, that resampling systematically can prevent the filtered density from
converging towards the true posterior distribution. We discuss several means to
overcome this limitation, including kernel bandwidth modulation, and provide
evidence that the resulting particle filter clearly outperforms traditional
bootstrap particle filters. Our results are supported by numerical simulations
on a linear textbook example, the logistic map and a non-linear plant growth
model.

with respect to some of the control variables and nonlinear in relation to the
others. We consider finitely many equality and inequality constraints on the
initial and final values of the state. We investigate singular optimal
solutions for this class of problems, for which we obtain second order
necessary and sufficient conditions for weak optimality in integral form. We
also derive Goh pointwise necessary optimality conditions. We show an example

symmetry under magnetic field. In order to describe this mixing, we extend the
linearized Eliashberg equation for the spin and charge fluctuation mechanism in
strongly correlated electron systems. We apply this extended Eliashberg
equation to the odd-frequency superconductivity on a quasi-one-dimensional
isosceles triangular lattice under in-plane magnetic field and examine the
effect of the even-frequency component.

3130,3131,New goodness-of-fit diagnostics for conditional discrete response models,"  This paper proposes new specification tests for conditional models with
discrete responses, which are key to apply efficient maximum likelihood
methods, to obtain consistent estimates of partial effects and to get
appropriate predictions of the probability of future events. In particular, we
test the static and dynamic ordered choice model specifications and can cover
infinite support distributions for e.g. count data. The traditional approach
for specification testing of discrete response models is based on probability
integral transforms of a jittered discrete data which leads to continuous
uniform iid series under the true conditional distribution. Then, standard
specification testing techniques for continuous variables could be applied to
the transformed series, but the extra randomness from jitters affects the power
properties of these methods. We investigate in this paper an alternative
transformation based only on original discrete data that avoids any
randomization. We analyze the asymptotic properties of goodness-of-fit tests
based on this new transformation and explore the properties in finite samples
of a bootstrap algorithm to approximate the critical values of test statistics
which are model and parameter dependent. We show analytically and in
simulations that our approach dominates the methods based on randomization in
terms of power. We apply the new tests to models of the monetary policy
conducted by the Federal Reserve.

5359,5360,Geometric clustering in normed planes,"  Given two sets of points $A$ and $B$ in a normed plane, we prove that there
are two linearly separable sets $A'$ and $B'$ such that $\mathrm{diam}(A')\leq
\mathrm{diam}(A)$, $\mathrm{diam}(B')\leq \mathrm{diam}(B)$, and $A'\cup
B'=A\cup B.$ This extends a result for the Euclidean distance to symmetric
convex distance functions. As a consequence, some Euclidean $k$-clustering
algorithms are adapted to normed planes, for instance, those that minimize the
maximum, the sum, or the sum of squares of the $k$ cluster diameters. The
2-clustering problem when two different bounds are imposed to the diameters is
also solved. The Hershberger-Suri's data structure for managing ball hulls can
be useful in this context.

2419,2420,Universal Protocols for Information Dissemination Using Emergent Signals,"  We consider a population of $n$ agents which communicate with each other in a
decentralized manner, through random pairwise interactions. One or more agents
in the population may act as authoritative sources of information, and the
objective of the remaining agents is to obtain information from or about these
source agents. We study two basic tasks: broadcasting, in which the agents are
to learn the bit-state of an authoritative source which is present in the
population, and source detection, in which the agents are required to decide if
at least one source agent is present in the population or not.We focus on
designing protocols which meet two natural conditions: (1) universality, i.e.,
independence of population size, and (2) rapid convergence to a correct global
state after a reconfiguration, such as a change in the state of a source agent.
Our main positive result is to show that both of these constraints can be met.
For both the broadcasting problem and the source detection problem, we obtain
solutions with a convergence time of $O(\log^2 n)$ rounds, w.h.p., from any
starting configuration. The solution to broadcasting is exact, which means that
all agents reach the state broadcast by the source, while the solution to
source detection admits one-sided error on a $\varepsilon$-fraction of the
population (which is unavoidable for this problem). Both protocols are easy to
implement in practice and have a compact formulation.Our protocols exploit the
properties of self-organizing oscillatory dynamics. On the hardness side, our
main structural insight is to prove that any protocol which meets the
constraints of universality and of rapid convergence after reconfiguration must
display a form of non-stationary behavior (of which oscillatory dynamics are an
example). We also observe that the periodicity of the oscillatory behavior of
the protocol, when present, must necessarily depend on the number $^\\# X$ of
source agents present in the population. For instance, our protocols inherently
rely on the emergence of a signal passing through the population, whose period
is $\Theta(\log \frac{n}{^\\# X})$ rounds for most starting configurations. The
design of clocks with tunable frequency may be of independent interest, notably
in modeling biological networks.

10534,10535,A Constrained Coupled Matrix-Tensor Factorization for Learning Time-evolving and Emerging Topics,"  Topic discovery has witnessed a significant growth as a field of data mining
at large. In particular, time-evolving topic discovery, where the evolution of
a topic is taken into account has been instrumental in understanding the
historical context of an emerging topic in a dynamic corpus. Traditionally,
time-evolving topic discovery has focused on this notion of time. However,
especially in settings where content is contributed by a community or a crowd,
an orthogonal notion of time is the one that pertains to the level of expertise
of the content creator: the more experienced the creator, the more advanced the
topic. In this paper, we propose a novel time-evolving topic discovery method
which, in addition to the extracted topics, is able to identify the evolution
of that topic over time, as well as the level of difficulty of that topic, as
it is inferred by the level of expertise of its main contributors. Our method
is based on a novel formulation of Constrained Coupled Matrix-Tensor
Factorization, which adopts constraints well-motivated for, and, as we
demonstrate, are essential for high-quality topic discovery. We qualitatively
evaluate our approach using real data from the Physics and also Programming
Stack Exchange forum, and we were able to identify topics of varying levels of
difficulty which can be linked to external events, such as the announcement of
gravitational waves by the LIGO lab in Physics forum. We provide a quantitative
evaluation of our method by conducting a user study where experts were asked to
judge the coherence and quality of the extracted topics. Finally, our proposed
method has implications for automatic curriculum design using the extracted
topics, where the notion of the level of difficulty is necessary for the proper
modeling of prerequisites and advanced concepts.

9103,9104,Achieving Privacy in the Adversarial Multi-Armed Bandit,"  In this paper, we improve the previously best known regret bound to achieve
$\epsilon$-differential privacy in oblivious adversarial bandits from
$\mathcal{O}{(T^{2/3}/\epsilon)}$ to $\mathcal{O}{(\sqrt{T} \ln T /\epsilon)}$.
This is achieved by combining a Laplace Mechanism with EXP3. We show that
though EXP3 is already differentially private, it leaks a linear amount of
information in $T$. However, we can improve this privacy by relying on its
intrinsic exponential mechanism for selecting actions. This allows us to reach
$\mathcal{O}{(\sqrt{\ln T})}$-DP, with a regret of $\mathcal{O}{(T^{2/3})}$
that holds against an adaptive adversary, an improvement from the best known of
$\mathcal{O}{(T^{3/4})}$. This is done by using an algorithm that run EXP3 in a
mini-batch loop. Finally, we run experiments that clearly demonstrate the
validity of our theoretical analysis.

5363,5364,Dropping Convexity for More Efficient and Scalable Online Multiview Learning,"  Multiview representation learning is very popular for latent factor analysis.
It naturally arises in many data analysis, machine learning, and information
retrieval applications to model dependent structures among multiple data
sources. For computational convenience, existing approaches usually formulate
the multiview representation learning as convex optimization problems, where
global optima can be obtained by certain algorithms in polynomial time.
However, many pieces of evidence have corroborated that heuristic nonconvex
approaches also have good empirical computational performance and convergence
to the global optima, although there is a lack of theoretical justification.
Such a gap between theory and practice motivates us to study a nonconvex
formulation for multiview representation learning, which can be efficiently
solved by a simple stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm. We first
illustrate the geometry of the nonconvex formulation; Then, we establish
asymptotic global rates of convergence to the global optima by diffusion
approximations. Numerical experiments are provided to support our theory.

460,461,Kinetic modelling of competition and depletion of shared miRNAs by competing endogenous RNAs,"  Non-conding RNAs play a key role in the post-transcriptional regulation of
mRNA translation and turnover in eukaryotes. miRNAs, in particular, interact
with their target RNAs through protein-mediated, sequence-specific binding,
giving rise to extended and highly heterogeneous miRNA-RNA interaction
networks. Within such networks, competition to bind miRNAs can generate an
effective positive coupling between their targets. Competing endogenous RNAs
(ceRNAs) can in turn regulate each other through miRNA-mediated crosstalk.
Albeit potentially weak, ceRNA interactions can occur both dynamically,
affecting e.g. the regulatory clock, and at stationarity, in which case ceRNA
networks as a whole can be implicated in the composition of the cell's
proteome. Many features of ceRNA interactions, including the conditions under
which they become significant, can be unraveled by mathematical and in silico
models. We review the understanding of the ceRNA effect obtained within such
frameworks, focusing on the methods employed to quantify it, its role in the
processing of gene expression noise, and how network topology can determine its
reach.

18038,18039,"Fast, Robust, and Versatile Event Detection through HMM Belief State Gradient Measures","  Event detection is a critical feature in data-driven systems as it assists
with the identification of nominal and anomalous behavior. Event detection is
increasingly relevant in robotics as robots operate with greater autonomy in
increasingly unstructured environments. In this work, we present an accurate,

theoretical proof establishes the link between the derivative of the
log-likelihood of the HMM filtered belief state and the latest emission
probabilities. The key insight is the inverse relationship in which gradient
analysis is used for skill and anomaly identification. Our measure showed
better performance across all metrics than related state-of-the art works. The
result is broadly applicable to domains that use HMMs for event detection.

10392,10393,Self-supervised Deep Reinforcement Learning with Generalized Computation Graphs for Robot Navigation,"  Enabling robots to autonomously navigate complex environments is essential
for real-world deployment. Prior methods approach this problem by having the
robot maintain an internal map of the world, and then use a localization and
planning method to navigate through the internal map. However, these approaches
often include a variety of assumptions, are computationally intensive, and do
not learn from failures. In contrast, learning-based methods improve as the
robot acts in the environment, but are difficult to deploy in the real-world
due to their high sample complexity. To address the need to learn complex
policies with few samples, we propose a generalized computation graph that
subsumes value-based model-free methods and model-based methods, with specific
instantiations interpolating between model-free and model-based. We then
instantiate this graph to form a navigation model that learns from raw images
and is sample efficient. Our simulated car experiments explore the design
decisions of our navigation model, and show our approach outperforms
single-step and $N$-step double Q-learning. We also evaluate our approach on a
real-world RC car and show it can learn to navigate through a complex indoor
environment with a few hours of fully autonomous, self-supervised training.

induced from corpus data such as those from VerbKB (Wijaya, 2016), on the other
hand, can give clusters with much larger coverage, and can be adapted to
specific corpora such as Twitter. We present a method for clustering the
outputs of VerbKB: verbs with their multiple argument types, e.g.
""marry(person, person)"", ""feel(person, emotion)."" We make use of a novel
low-dimensional embedding of verbs and their arguments to produce high quality
clusters in which the same verb can be in different clusters depending on its
argument type. The resulting verb clusters do a better job than hand-built
clusters of predicting sarcasm, sentiment, and locus of control in tweets.

2637,2638,On-the-fly Operation Batching in Dynamic Computation Graphs,"  Dynamic neural network toolkits such as PyTorch, DyNet, and Chainer offer
more flexibility for implementing models that cope with data of varying
dimensions and structure, relative to toolkits that operate on statically
declared computations (e.g., TensorFlow, CNTK, and Theano). However, existing
toolkits - both static and dynamic - require that the developer organize the
computations into the batches necessary for exploiting high-performance
algorithms and hardware. This batching task is generally difficult, but it
becomes a major hurdle as architectures become complex. In this paper, we
present an algorithm, and its implementation in the DyNet toolkit, for
automatically batching operations. Developers simply write minibatch
computations as aggregations of single instance computations, and the batching
algorithm seamlessly executes them, on the fly, using computationally efficient
batched operations. On a variety of tasks, we obtain throughput similar to that
obtained with manual batches, as well as comparable speedups over
single-instance learning on architectures that are impractical to batch
manually.

7062,7063,Photometric Redshifts for Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program Data Release 1,"  Photometric redshifts are a key component of many science objectives in the
Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP). In this paper, we
describe and compare the codes used to compute photometric redshifts for
HSC-SSP, how we calibrate them, and the typical accuracy we achieve with the
HSC five-band photometry (grizy). We introduce a new point estimator based on
an improved loss function and demonstrate that it works better than other
commonly used estimators. We find that our photo-z's are most accurate at
0.2<~zphot<~1.5, where we can straddle the 4000A break. We achieve
sigma(d_zphot/(1+zphot))~0.05 and an outlier rate of about 15% for galaxies
down to i=25 within this redshift range. If we limit to a brighter sample of
i<24, we achieve sigma~0.04 and ~8% outliers. Our photo-z's should thus enable
many science cases for HSC-SSP. We also characterize the accuracy of our
redshift probability distribution function (PDF) and discover that some codes
over/under-estimate the redshift uncertainties, which have implications for
N(z) reconstruction. Our photo-z products for the entire area in the Public
Data Release 1 are publicly available, and both our catalog products (such as
point estimates) and full PDFs can be retrieved from the data release site,

6687,6688,Deep Learning: A Bayesian Perspective,"  Deep learning is a form of machine learning for nonlinear high dimensional
pattern matching and prediction. By taking a Bayesian probabilistic
perspective, we provide a number of insights into more efficient algorithms for
optimisation and hyper-parameter tuning. Traditional high-dimensional data
reduction techniques, such as principal component analysis (PCA), partial least
squares (PLS), reduced rank regression (RRR), projection pursuit regression
(PPR) are all shown to be shallow learners. Their deep learning counterparts
exploit multiple deep layers of data reduction which provide predictive
performance gains. Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) training optimisation and
Dropout (DO) regularization provide estimation and variable selection. Bayesian
regularization is central to finding weights and connections in networks to
optimize the predictive bias-variance trade-off. To illustrate our methodology,
we provide an analysis of international bookings on Airbnb. Finally, we
conclude with directions for future research.

20647,20648,Nearly Maximally Predictive Features and Their Dimensions,"  Scientific explanation often requires inferring maximally predictive features
from a given data set. Unfortunately, the collection of minimal maximally
predictive features for most stochastic processes is uncountably infinite. In
such cases, one compromises and instead seeks nearly maximally predictive
features. Here, we derive upper-bounds on the rates at which the number and the
coding cost of nearly maximally predictive features scales with desired
predictive power. The rates are determined by the fractal dimensions of a
process' mixed-state distribution. These results, in turn, show how widely-used
finite-order Markov models can fail as predictors and that mixed-state
predictive features offer a substantial improvement.

10734,10735,A Kepler Study of Starspot Lifetimes with Respect to Light Curve Amplitude and Spectral Type,"  Wide-field high precision photometric surveys such as Kepler have produced
reams of data suitable for investigating stellar magnetic activity of cooler
stars. Starspot activity produces quasi-sinusoidal light curves whose phase and
amplitude vary as active regions grow and decay over time. Here we investigate,
firstly, whether there is a correlation between the size of starspots - assumed
to be related to the amplitude of the sinusoid - and their decay timescale and,
secondly, whether any such correlation depends on the stellar effective
temperature. To determine this, we computed the autocorrelation functions of
the light curves of samples of stars from Kepler and fitted them with apodised
periodic functions. The light curve amplitudes, representing spot size were
measured from the root-mean-squared scatter of the normalised light curves. We
used a Monte Carlo Markov Chain to measure the periods and decay timescales of
the light curves. The results show a correlation between the decay time of
starspots and their inferred size. The decay time also depends strongly on the
temperature of the star. Cooler stars have spots that last much longer, in
particular for stars with longer rotational periods. This is consistent with
current theories of diffusive mechanisms causing starspot decay. We also find
that the Sun is not unusually quiet for its spectral type - stars with
solar-type rotation periods and temperatures tend to have (comparatively)
smaller starspots than stars with mid-G or later spectral types.

with given regularity behavior on $I$. Write $w:=\exp(-Q)$ on $I$ and assume
that $\int_I x^nw^2(x)dx<\infty$ for all $n=0,1,2,\ldots$. For $x\in I$, we

11269,11270,Conditions for the equivalence between IQC and graph separation stability results,"  This paper provides a link between time-domain and frequency-domain stability
results in the literature. Specifically, we focus on the comparison between
stability results for a feedback interconnection of two nonlinear systems
stated in terms of frequency-domain conditions. While the Integral Quadratic
Constrain (IQC) theorem can cope with them via a homotopy argument for the
Lurye problem, graph separation results require the transformation of the
frequency-domain conditions into truncated time-domain conditions. To date,
much of the literature focuses on ""hard"" factorizations of the multiplier,
considering only one of the two frequency-domain conditions. Here it is shown
that a symmetric, ""doubly-hard"" factorization is required to convert both
frequency-domain conditions into truncated time-domain conditions. By using the
appropriate factorization, a novel comparison between the results obtained by
IQC and separation theories is then provided. As a result, we identify under
what conditions the IQC theorem may provide some advantage.

4244,4245,A multiple timescales approach to bridging spiking- and population-level dynamics,"  A rigorous bridge between spiking-level and macroscopic quantities is an
on-going and well-developed story for asynchronously firing neurons, but focus
has shifted to include neural populations exhibiting varying synchronous
dynamics. Recent literature has used the Ott--Antonsen ansatz (2008) to great
effect, allowing a rigorous derivation of an order parameter for large
oscillator populations. The ansatz has been successfully applied using several
models including networks of Kuramoto oscillators, theta models, and
integrate-and-fire neurons, along with many types of network topologies. In the
present study, we take a converse approach: given the mean field dynamics of
slow synapses, predict the synchronization properties of finite neural
populations. The slow synapse assumption is amenable to averaging theory and
the method of multiple timescales. Our proposed theory applies to two
heterogeneous populations of N excitatory n-dimensional and N inhibitory
m-dimensional oscillators with homogeneous synaptic weights. We then
demonstrate our theory using two examples. In the first example we take a
network of excitatory and inhibitory theta neurons and consider the case with
and without heterogeneous inputs. In the second example we use Traub models
with calcium for the excitatory neurons and Wang-Buzs{á}ki models for the
inhibitory neurons. We accurately predict phase drift and phase locking in each
example even when the slow synapses exhibit non-trivial mean-field dynamics.

growing popularity among researchers, we here provide a comprehensive review of
major sampling strategies for the least squares based PCE. Traditional sampling
methods, such as Monte Carlo, Latin hypercube, quasi-Monte Carlo, optimal
design of experiments (ODE), Gaussian quadratures, as well as more recent
techniques, such as coherence-optimal and randomized quadratures are discussed.
We also propose a hybrid sampling method, dubbed alphabetic-coherence-optimal,
that employs the so-called alphabetic optimality criteria used in the context
of ODE in conjunction with coherence-optimal samples. A comparison between the
empirical performance of the selected sampling methods applied to three
numerical examples, including high-order PCE's, high-dimensional problems, and
low oversampling ratios, is presented to provide a road map for practitioners
seeking the most suitable sampling technique for a problem at hand. We observed
that the alphabetic-coherence-optimal technique outperforms other sampling
methods, specially when high-order ODE are employed and/or the oversampling

linear controllers to overcome drawbacks of droop control. However, linear
control design depends on an accurate model of the system. The derivation of
such a model is challenging because the noise and disturbances caused by the
coupling between sources, loads, and switches in microgrids are
under-represented. This under-representation makes linear modeling and control
insufficient. Hence, in this paper, we propose a robust adaptive control to
adjust droop characteristics to satisfy both current sharing and bus voltage
stability. First, the time-varying models of DC microgrids are derived. Second,
the improvements for the adaptive control method are presented. Third, the
application of the enhanced adaptive method to DC microgrids is presented to
satisfy the system objective. Fourth, simulation and experimental results on a
microgrid show that the adaptive method precisely shares current between two
distributed resources and maintains the nominal bus voltage. Last, the
comparative study validates the effectiveness of the proposed method over the
conventional method.

4247,4248,Contextuality from missing and versioned data,"  Traditionally categorical data analysis (e.g. generalized linear models)
works with simple, flat datasets akin to a single table in a database with no
notion of missing data or conflicting versions. In contrast, modern data
analysis must deal with distributed databases with many partial local tables
that need not always agree. The computational agents tabulating these tables
are spatially separated, with binding speed-of-light constraints and data
arriving too rapidly for these distributed views ever to be fully informed and
globally consistent. Contextuality is a mathematical property which describes a
kind of inconsistency arising in quantum mechanics (e.g. in Bell's theorem). In
this paper we show how contextuality can arise in common data collection
scenarios, including missing data and versioning (as in low-latency distributed
databases employing snapshot isolation). In the companion paper, we develop
statistical models adapted to this regime.

text classification. Tweets are a valuable source of micro-text (sometimes
referred to as ""micro-blogs""), and have been studied in domains such as
sentiment analysis, recommendation systems, spam detection, clustering, among
others. Tweets often include keywords referred to as ""Hashtags"" that can be
used as labels for the tweet. Using tweets encompassing 50 labels, we studied
the impact of word versus character-level feature selection and extraction on
different learners to solve a multi-class classification task. We show that
feature extraction of simple character-level groups performs better than simple
word groups and pre-processing methods like normalizing using Porter's Stemming

population-imbalanced one-dimensional Fermi gas that allows for
Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) type pairing correlations among the two
fermion species, while also accounting for the harmonic confining potential. In
the strongly interacting regime, we find large spatial oscillations of the
order parameter, indicative of an FFLO state. The obtained density profiles
versus imbalance are consistent with recent experimental results as well as
with theoretical calculations based on combining Bethe ansatz with the local
density approximation. Although we find no signature of the FFLO state in the
densities of the two fermion species, we show that the oscillations of the
order parameter appear in density-density correlations, both in-situ and after
free expansion. Furthermore, above a critical polarization, the value of which
depends on the interaction, we find the unpaired Fermi-gas state to be
energetically more favorable.

statistical study reveals itself as a useful tool for obtaining the orientation
of the ambient magnetic field, previous to be swept up by the main supernova

weighted first-order rules which act as templates for constructing feed-forward
neural networks. While previous work has shown that using LRNNs can lead to
state-of-the-art results in various ILP tasks, these results depended on
hand-crafted rules. In this paper, we extend the framework of LRNNs with
structure learning, thus enabling a fully automated learning process. Similarly
to many ILP methods, our structure learning algorithm proceeds in an iterative
fashion by top-down searching through the hypothesis space of all possible Horn
clauses, considering the predicates that occur in the training examples as well
as invented soft concepts entailed by the best weighted rules found so far. In
the experiments, we demonstrate the ability to automatically induce useful
hierarchical soft concepts leading to deep LRNNs with a competitive predictive

\textbf{V}ariational \textbf{Gr}adient Fl\textbf{ow} (VGrow) on probability
spaces. The evolving distribution that asymptotically converges to the target
distribution is governed by a vector field, which is the negative gradient of
the first variation of the $f$-divergence between them. We prove that the
evolving distribution coincides with the pushforward distribution through the
infinitesimal time composition of residual maps that are perturbations of the
identity map along the vector field. The vector field depends on the density
ratio of the pushforward distribution and the target distribution, which can be
consistently learned from a binary classification problem. Connections of our
proposed VGrow method with other popular methods, such as VAE, GAN and
flow-based methods, have been established in this framework, gaining new
insights of deep generative learning. We also evaluated several commonly used
divergences, including Kullback-Leibler, Jensen-Shannon, Jeffrey divergences as
well as our newly discovered `logD' divergence which serves as the objective
function of the logD-trick GAN. Experimental results on benchmark datasets
demonstrate that VGrow can generate high-fidelity images in a stable and
efficient manner, achieving competitive performance with state-of-the-art GANs.

In contrast to existing techniques, LoopInvGen is not restricted to a fixed
set of features -- atomic predicates that are composed together to build
complex loop invariants. Instead, we start with no initial features, and use
program synthesis techniques to grow the set on demand. This not only enables a
less onerous and more expressive approach, but also appears to be significantly
faster than the existing tools over the SyGuS-COMP 2017 benchmarks from the INV

358,359,A one-dimensional model for water desalination by flow-through electrode capacitive deionization,"  Capacitive deionization (CDI) is a fast-emerging water desalination
technology in which a small cell voltage of ~1 V across porous carbon
electrodes removes salt from feedwaters via electrosorption. In flow-through
electrode (FTE) CDI cell architecture, feedwater is pumped through macropores
or laser perforated channels in porous electrodes, enabling highly compact
cells with parallel flow and electric field, as well as rapid salt removal. We
here present a one-dimensional model describing water desalination by FTE CDI,
and a comparison to data from a custom-built experimental cell. The model
employs simple cell boundary conditions derived via scaling arguments. We show
good model-to-data fits with reasonable values for fitting parameters such as
the Stern layer capacitance, micropore volume, and attraction energy. Thus, we
demonstrate that from an engineering modeling perspective, an FTE CDI cell may
be described with simpler one-dimensional models, unlike more typical
flow-between electrodes architecture where 2D models are required.

$m$ and $n$, a group $G$ satisfies the law if and only if the power subgroups
$G^m$ and $G^n$ both satisfy the law. We prove that for all positive integers
$c$, nilpotency of class at most $c$ is detectable in power subgroups, as is
the $k$-Engel law for $k$ at most 4. In contrast, detectability in power
subgroups fails for solvability of given derived length: we construct a finite

$3$. We analyse the complexity of the detectability of commutativity in power
subgroups, in terms of finite presentations that encode a proof of the result.

obtained by the gateway Hamiltonian method ({\it J. Chem. Phys.} {\bf 142},
174107 (2015); {\it ibid.} {\bf 143}, 064104 (2015)). The kinetic energy
operator in this general Hamiltonian is nearly identical with that of the
Eckart-Watson operator even when curvilinear vibrational coordinates are
employed. Its different realizations correspond to different methods of
calculating Eckart displacements. There are at least two different methods for
calculating such displacements: rotation and projection. In this communication
the application of Eckart Hamiltonian operators constructed by rotation and
projection, respectively, is numerically demonstrated in calculating
vibrational energy levels. The numerical examples confirm that there is no need
for rotation to construct an Eckart ro-vibrational Hamiltonian. The application
of the gateway method is advantageous even when rotation is used, since it
obviates the need for differentiation of the matrix rotating into the Eckart
frame. Simple geometrical arguments explain that there are infinitely many
different methods for calculating Eckart displacements. The geometrical picture
also suggests that a unique Eckart displacement vector may be defined as the
shortest (mass-weighted) Eckart displacement vector among Eckart displacement
vectors corresponding to configurations related by rotation. Its length, as
shown analytically and demonstrated by way of numerical examples, is equal to
or less than that of the Eckart displacement vector one can obtain by rotation
to the Eckart frame.

for radar signal processing applications is addressed in this paper. This
represents a key issue because many detection architectures are synthesized
assuming a specific covariance structure which may not necessarily coincide
with the actual one due to the joint action of the system and environment
uncertainties. The considered classification problem is cast in terms of a
multiple hypotheses test with some nested alternatives and the theory of Model
Order Selection (MOS) is exploited to devise suitable decision rules. Several
MOS techniques, such as the Akaike, Takeuchi, and Bayesian information criteria
are adopted and the corresponding merits and drawbacks are discussed. At the

12966,12967,Detecting Strong Ties Using Network Motifs,"  Detecting strong ties among users in social and information networks is a
fundamental operation that can improve performance on a multitude of
personalization and ranking tasks. Strong-tie edges are often readily obtained
from the social network as users often participate in multiple overlapping
networks via features such as following and messaging. These networks may vary
greatly in size, density and the information they carry. This setting leads to
a natural strong tie detection task: given a small set of labeled strong tie
edges, how well can one detect unlabeled strong ties in the remainder of the
network?
This task becomes particularly daunting for the Twitter network due to scant
availability of pairwise relationship attribute data, and sparsity of strong
tie networks such as phone contacts. Given these challenges, a natural approach
is to instead use structural network features for the task, produced by {\em
combining} the strong and ""weak"" edges. In this work, we demonstrate via
experiments on Twitter data that using only such structural network features is
sufficient for detecting strong ties with high precision. These structural
network features are obtained from the presence and frequency of small network
motifs on combined strong and weak ties. We observe that using motifs larger
than triads alleviate sparsity problems that arise for smaller motifs, both due
to increased combinatorial possibilities as well as benefiting strongly from
searching beyond the ego network. Empirically, we observe that not all motifs
are equally useful, and need to be carefully constructed from the combined
edges in order to be effective for strong tie detection. Finally, we reinforce
our experimental findings with providing theoretical justification that
suggests why incorporating these larger sized motifs as features could lead to
increased performance in planted graph models.

10955,10956,Generating large misalignments in gapped and binary discs,"  Many protostellar gapped and binary discs show misalignments between their
inner and outer discs; in some cases, $\sim70$ degree misalignments have been
observed. Here we show that these misalignments can be generated through a
""secular precession resonance"" between the nodal precession of the inner disc
and the precession of the gap-opening (stellar or massive planetary) companion.
An evolving protostellar system may naturally cross this resonance during its
lifetime due to disc dissipation and/or companion migration. If resonance
crossing occurs on the right timescale, of order a few Myrs, characteristic for
young protostellar systems, the inner and outer discs can become highly
misaligned ($\gtrsim 60$ degrees). When the primary star has a mass of order a
solar mass, generating a significant misalignment typically requires the
companion to have a mass of $\sim 0.01-0.1$ M$_\odot$ and an orbital separation
of tens of AU. The recently observed companion in the cavity of the gapped,
highly misaligned system HD 142527 satisfies these requirements, indicating
that a previous resonance crossing event misaligned the inner and outer discs.
Our scenario for HD 142527's misaligned discs predicts that the companion's
orbital plane is aligned with the outer disc's; this prediction should be
testable with future observations as the companion's orbit is mapped out.
Misalignments observed in several other gapped disc systems could be generated
by the same secular resonance mechanism.

13128,13129,Deep Generative Models with Learnable Knowledge Constraints,"  The broad set of deep generative models (DGMs) has achieved remarkable
advances. However, it is often difficult to incorporate rich structured domain
knowledge with the end-to-end DGMs. Posterior regularization (PR) offers a
principled framework to impose structured constraints on probabilistic models,
but has limited applicability to the diverse DGMs that can lack a Bayesian
formulation or even explicit density evaluation. PR also requires constraints
to be fully specified a priori, which is impractical or suboptimal for complex
knowledge with learnable uncertain parts. In this paper, we establish
mathematical correspondence between PR and reinforcement learning (RL), and,
based on the connection, expand PR to learn constraints as the extrinsic reward
in RL. The resulting algorithm is model-agnostic to apply to any DGMs, and is
flexible to adapt arbitrary constraints with the model jointly. Experiments on
human image generation and templated sentence generation show models with
learned knowledge constraints by our algorithm greatly improve over base
generative models.

decomposition of tasks and use of hierarchical methods hold the potential to
significantly speed up learning in such domains. This paper proposes a novel
practical method that can autonomously decompose tasks, by leveraging
association rule mining, which discovers hidden relationship among entities in
data mining. We introduce a novel method called ARM-HSTRL (Association Rule
Mining to extract Hierarchical Structure of Tasks in Reinforcement Learning).
It extracts temporal and structural relationships of sub-goals in RL, and
multi-task RL. In particular,it finds sub-goals and relationship among them. It
is shown the significant efficiency and performance of the proposed method in

pseudoeffective divisor $D$ to a subvariety $Y$ with nef normal bundle is
pseudoeffective. Assuming the normal bundle is ample and that $D|_Y$ is not
big, we prove that the numerical dimension of $D$ is bounded above by that of
its restriction, i.e. $\kappa_{\sigma}(D)\leq \kappa_{\sigma}(D|_Y)$. The main
motivation is to study the cycle classes of ""positive"" curves: we show that the
cycle class of a curve with ample normal bundle lies in the interior of the
cone of curves, and the cycle class of an ample curve lies in the interior of
the cone of movable curves. We do not impose any condition on the singularities
on the curve or the ambient variety. For locally complete intersection curves
in a smooth projective variety, this is the main result of Ottem \cite{Ott16}.
The main tool in this paper is the theory of $q$-ample divisors.

19967,19968,Super-blockers and the effect of network structure on information cascades,"  Modelling information cascades over online social networks is important in
fields from marketing to civil unrest prediction, however the underlying
network structure strongly affects the probability and nature of such cascades.
Even with simple cascade dynamics the probability of large cascades are almost
entirely dictated by network properties, with well-known networks such as
Erdos-Renyi and Barabasi-Albert producing wildly different cascades from the
same model. Indeed, the notion of 'superspreaders' has arisen to describe
highly influential nodes promoting global cascades in a social network. Here we
use a simple model of global cascades to show that the presence of locality in
the network increases the probability of a global cascade due to the increased
vulnerability of connecting nodes. Rather than 'super-spreaders', we find that
the presence of these highly connected 'super-blockers' in heavy-tailed
networks in fact reduces the probability of global cascades, while promoting
information spread when targeted as the initial spreader.

These optimal control techniques are used to find pulse shapes that can perform

parameters. The simulations were all performed using experimentally relevant

mapping function from a degraded input to the clean output. In this letter, we
propose a self-committee method that can find enhanced restoration results from
the multiple trial of a trained CNN with different but related inputs.
Specifically, it is noted that the CNN sometimes finds different mapping
functions when the input is transformed by a reversible transform and thus
produces different but related outputs with the original. Hence averaging the
outputs for several different transformed inputs can enhance the results as
evidenced by the network committee methods. Unlike the conventional committee
approaches that require several networks, the proposed method needs only a
single network. Experimental results show that adding an additional transform
as a committee always brings additional gain on image denoising and single
image supre-resolution problems.

particular emphasis on the duality between relations and adjoint homomorphisms.
Using these categories, we then reformulate the semantics of DEL in a more

demonstrated: The DEL idea of updating a model into another is captured
naturally by the categorical perspective -- which emphasizes a family of
objects and structural relationships among them, as opposed to a single object
and structure on it. Also, the categorical semantics of DEL can be merged
straightforwardly with a standard categorical semantics for first-order logic,
providing a semantics for first-order DEL.

low-dimensional nonlinear manifolds; thus an approach to clustering is
identifying and separating these manifolds. In this paper, we present a novel
approach to solve this problem by using a mixture of autoencoders. Our model
consists of two parts: 1) a collection of autoencoders where each autoencoder
learns the underlying manifold of a group of similar objects, and 2) a mixture
assignment neural network, which takes the concatenated latent vectors from the
autoencoders as input and infers the distribution over clusters. By jointly
optimizing the two parts, we simultaneously assign data to clusters and learn

664,665,Multi-dimensional Graph Fourier Transform,"  Many signals on Cartesian product graphs appear in the real world, such as
digital images, sensor observation time series, and movie ratings on Netflix.
These signals are ""multi-dimensional"" and have directional characteristics
along each factor graph. However, the existing graph Fourier transform does not
distinguish these directions, and assigns 1-D spectra to signals on product
graphs. Further, these spectra are often multi-valued at some frequencies. Our
main result is a multi-dimensional graph Fourier transform that solves such
problems associated with the conventional GFT. Using algebraic properties of
Cartesian products, the proposed transform rearranges 1-D spectra obtained by
the conventional GFT into the multi-dimensional frequency domain, of which each
dimension represents a directional frequency along each factor graph. Thus, the
multi-dimensional graph Fourier transform enables directional frequency
analysis, in addition to frequency analysis with the conventional GFT.
Moreover, this rearrangement resolves the multi-valuedness of spectra in some
cases. The multi-dimensional graph Fourier transform is a foundation of novel
filterings and stationarities that utilize dimensional information of graph
signals, which are also discussed in this study. The proposed methods are
applicable to a wide variety of data that can be regarded as signals on
Cartesian product graphs. This study also notes that multivariate graph signals
can be regarded as 2-D univariate graph signals. This correspondence provides
natural definitions of the multivariate graph Fourier transform and the
multivariate stationarity based on their 2-D univariate versions.

~5500 local (z<0.1) star-forming galaxies and obtain an estimate of their
average total-to-selective attenuation $k(\lambda)$. We utilize data from the
United Kingdom Infrared Telescope (UKIRT) and the Two Micron All-Sky Survey
(2MASS), which is combined with previously measured UV-optical data for these
galaxies. The average attenuation curve is slightly lower in the far-UV than
local starburst galaxies, by roughly 15%, but appears similar at longer
wavelengths with a total-to-selective normalization at V-band of
$R_V=3.67\substack{+0.44 \\ -0.35}$. Under the assumption of energy balance,
the total attenuated energy inferred from this curve is found to be broadly
consistent with the observed infrared dust emission ($L_{\rm{TIR}}$) in a small
sample of local galaxies for which far-IR measurements are available. However,
the significant scatter in this quantity among the sample may reflect large
variations in the attenuation properties of individual galaxies. We also derive
the attenuation curve for sub-populations of the main sample, separated
according to mean stellar population age (via $D_n4000$), specific star
formation rate, stellar mass, and metallicity, and find that they show only
tentative trends with low significance, at least over the range which is probed
by our sample. These results indicate that a single curve is reasonable for
applications seeking to broadly characterize large samples of galaxies in the
local Universe, while applications to individual galaxies would yield large
uncertainties and is not recommended.

learning architectures for audio processing and we aim to find a general
purpose end-to-end deep neural network to perform modeling of nonlinear audio
effects. We show the network modeling various nonlinearities and we discuss the
generalization capabilities among different instruments.

17774,17775,Mendelian randomization with fine-mapped genetic data: choosing from large numbers of correlated instrumental variables,"  Mendelian randomization uses genetic variants to make causal inferences about
the effect of a risk factor on an outcome. With fine-mapped genetic data, there
may be hundreds of genetic variants in a single gene region any of which could
be used to assess this causal relationship. However, using too many genetic
variants in the analysis can lead to spurious estimates and inflated Type 1
error rates. But if only a few genetic variants are used, then the majority of
the data is ignored and estimates are highly sensitive to the particular choice
of variants. We propose an approach based on summarized data only (genetic
association and correlation estimates) that uses principal components analysis
to form instruments. This approach has desirable theoretical properties: it
takes the totality of data into account and does not suffer from numerical
instabilities. It also has good properties in simulation studies: it is not
particularly sensitive to varying the genetic variants included in the analysis
or the genetic correlation matrix, and it does not have greatly inflated Type 1
error rates. Overall, the method gives estimates that are not so precise as
those from variable selection approaches (such as using a conditional analysis
or pruning approach to select variants), but are more robust to seemingly
arbitrary choices in the variable selection step. Methods are illustrated by an
example using genetic associations with testosterone for 320 genetic variants
to assess the effect of sex hormone-related pathways on coronary artery disease
risk, in which variable selection approaches give inconsistent inferences.

region of the nearby galaxy cluster Abell 2199 at $z=0.03$. By combining 775
new redshifts from the MMT/Hectospec observations with the data in the
literature, we construct a large sample of 1624 galaxies with measured
redshifts at $R<30^\prime$, which results in high spectroscopic completeness at
$r_{\rm petro,0}<20.5$ (77%). We use these data to study the kinematics and
clustering of galaxies focusing on the comparison with those of the
intracluster medium (ICM) from Suzaku X-ray observations. We identify 406
member galaxies of A2199 at $R<30^\prime$ using the caustic technique. The
velocity dispersion profile of cluster members appears smoothly connected to
the stellar velocity dispersion profile of the cD galaxy. The luminosity
function is well fitted with a Schechter function at $M_r<-15$. The radial
velocities of cluster galaxies generally agree well with those of the ICM, but
there are some regions where the velocity difference between the two is about a
few hundred kilometer per second. The cluster galaxies show a hint of global
rotation at $R<5^\prime$ with $v_{\rm rot}=300{-}600\,\textrm{km s}^{-1}$, but
the ICM in the same region do not show such rotation. We apply a
friends-of-friends algorithm to the cluster galaxy sample at $R<60^\prime$ and
identify 32 group candidates, and examine the spatial correlation between the
galaxy groups and X-ray emission. This extensive survey in the central region
of A2199 provides an important basis for future studies of interplay among the
galaxies, the ICM and the dark matter in the cluster.

3155,3156,Learning from various labeling strategies for suicide-related messages on social media: An experimental study,"  Suicide is an important but often misunderstood problem, one that researchers
are now seeking to better understand through social media. Due in large part to
the fuzzy nature of what constitutes suicidal risks, most supervised approaches
for learning to automatically detect suicide-related activity in social media
require a great deal of human labor to train. However, humans themselves have
diverse or conflicting views on what constitutes suicidal thoughts. So how to
obtain reliable gold standard labels is fundamentally challenging and, we
hypothesize, depends largely on what is asked of the annotators and what slice
of the data they label. We conducted multiple rounds of data labeling and
collected annotations from crowdsourcing workers and domain experts. We
aggregated the resulting labels in various ways to train a series of supervised
models. Our preliminary evaluations show that using unanimously agreed labels
from multiple annotators is helpful to achieve robust machine models.

7901,7902,ELICA: An Automated Tool for Dynamic Extraction of Requirements Relevant Information,"  Requirements elicitation requires extensive knowledge and deep understanding
of the problem domain where the final system will be situated. However, in many
software development projects, analysts are required to elicit the requirements
from an unfamiliar domain, which often causes communication barriers between
analysts and stakeholders. In this paper, we propose a requirements ELICitation
Aid tool (ELICA) to help analysts better understand the target application
domain by dynamic extraction and labeling of requirements-relevant knowledge.
To extract the relevant terms, we leverage the flexibility and power of
Weighted Finite State Transducers (WFSTs) in dynamic modeling of natural
language processing tasks. In addition to the information conveyed through
text, ELICA captures and processes non-linguistic information about the
intention of speakers such as their confidence level, analytical tone, and
emotions. The extracted information is made available to the analysts as a set
of labeled snippets with highlighted relevant terms which can also be exported
as an artifact of the Requirements Engineering (RE) process. The application
and usefulness of ELICA are demonstrated through a case study. This study shows
how pre-existing relevant information about the application domain and the
information captured during an elicitation meeting, such as the conversation
and stakeholders' intentions, can be captured and used to support analysts
achieving their tasks.

evidence and signal when systematic reviews become out of date. However, this
use has been limited to date due to the extensive manual review required to
search for and screen relevant trial registrations. Our aim was to evaluate a
new method that could partially automate the identification of trial
registrations that may be relevant for systematic review updates. We identified
179 systematic reviews of drug interventions for type 2 diabetes, which
included 537 clinical trials that had registrations in ClinicalTrials.gov. We
tested a matrix factorisation approach that uses a shared latent space to learn
how to rank relevant trial registrations for each systematic review, comparing
the performance to document similarity to rank relevant trial registrations.
The two approaches were tested on a holdout set of the newest trials from the
set of type 2 diabetes systematic reviews and an unseen set of 141 clinical
trial registrations from 17 updated systematic reviews published in the
Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. The matrix factorisation approach
outperformed the document similarity approach with a median rank of 59 and
recall@100 of 60.9%, compared to a median rank of 138 and recall@100 of 42.8%
in the document similarity baseline. In the second set of systematic reviews
and their updates, the highest performing approach used document similarity and
gave a median rank of 67 (recall@100 of 62.9%). The proposed method was useful
for ranking trial registrations to reduce the manual workload associated with
finding relevant trials for systematic review updates. The results suggest that
the approach could be used as part of a semi-automated pipeline for monitoring
potentially new evidence for inclusion in a review update.

11428,11429,A complete characterization of optimal dictionaries for least squares representation,"  Dictionaries are collections of vectors used for representations of elements
in Euclidean spaces. While recent research on optimal dictionaries is focussed
on providing sparse (i.e., $\ell_0$-optimal,) representations, here we consider
the problem of finding optimal dictionaries such that representations of
samples of a random vector are optimal in an $\ell_2$-sense. For us, optimality
of representation is equivalent to minimization of the average $\ell_2$-norm of
the coefficients used to represent the random vector, with the lengths of the
dictionary vectors being specified a priori. With the help of recent results on
rank-$1$ decompositions of symmetric positive semidefinite matrices and the
theory of majorization, we provide a complete characterization of
$\ell_2$-optimal dictionaries. Our results are accompanied by polynomial time
algorithms that construct $\ell_2$-optimal dictionaries from given data.

3095,3096,Monitoring Information Quality within Web Service Composition and Execution,"  The composition of web services is a promising approach enabling flexible and
loose integration of business applications. Numerous approaches related to web
services composition have been developed usually following three main phases:
the service discovery is based on the semantic description of advertised
services, i.e. the functionality of the service, meanwhile the service
selection is based on non- functional quality dimensions of service, and
finally the service composition aims to support an underlying process. Most of
those approaches explore techniques of static or dynamic design for an optimal
service composition. One important aspect so far is mostly neglected, focusing
on the output produced of composite web services. In this paper, in contrast to
many prominent approaches we introduce a data quality perspective on web
services. Based on a data quality management approach, we propose a framework
for analyzing data produced by the composite service execution. Utilising
process information together with data in service logs, our approach allows
identifying problems in service composition and execution. Analyzing the
service execution history our approach helps to improve common approaches of
service selection and composition.

construction of a sufficiently complicated noded Schottky group of rank three
and it is explained how to construct explicit non-classical Schottky groups of

1468,1469,Generalized Dirac structure beyond the linear regime in graphene,"  We show that a generalized Dirac structure survives beyond the linear regime
of the low-energy dispersion relations of graphene. A generalized uncertainty
principle of the kind compatible with specific quantum gravity scenarios with a
fundamental minimal length (here graphene lattice spacing) and Lorentz
violation (here the particle/hole asymmetry, the trigonal warping, etc.) is
naturally obtained. We then show that the corresponding emergent field theory
is a table-top realization of such scenarios, by explicitly computing the third
order Hamiltonian, and giving the general recipe for any order. Remarkably, our
results imply that going beyond the low-energy approximation does not spoil the
well-known correspondence with analogue massless quantum electrodynamics
phenomena (as usually believed), but rather it is a way to obtain experimental
signatures of quantum-gravity-like corrections to such phenomena.

clusters to study the highest-redshift Universe and cluster mass distributions
relies on precise lens mass modelling. In this work, we present the first
attempt at modelling line-of-sight mass distribution in addition to that of the
cluster, extending previous modelling techniques that assume mass distributions
to be on a single lens plane. We focus on the Hubble Frontier Field cluster
MACS J0416.1-2403, and our multi-plane model reproduces the observed image
positions with a rms offset of ~0.53"". Starting from this best-fitting model,
we simulate a mock cluster that resembles MACS J0416.1-2403 in order to explore
the effects of line-of-sight structures on cluster mass modelling. By
systematically analysing the mock cluster under different model assumptions, we
find that neglecting the lensing environment has a significant impact on the
reconstruction of image positions (rms ~0.3""); accounting for line-of-sight
galaxies as if they were at the cluster redshift can partially reduce this
offset. Moreover, foreground galaxies are more important to include into the
model than the background ones. While the magnification factors of the lensed
multiple images are recovered within ~10% for ~95% of them, those ~5% that lie
near critical curves can be significantly affected by the exclusion of the
lensing environment in the models (up to a factor of ~200). In addition,
line-of-sight galaxies cannot explain the apparent discrepancy in the
properties of massive subhalos between MACS J0416.1-2403 and N-body simulated
clusters. Since our model of MACS J0416.1-2403 with line-of-sight galaxies only
reduced modestly the rms offset in the image positions, we conclude that
additional complexities, such as more flexible halo shapes, would be needed in
future models of MACS J0416.1-2403.

metals to a variety of minor metals, such as cobalt or indium. The industrial
importance and limited geological availability of some minor metals have led to
them being considered more ""critical,"" and there is a growing investment
interest in such critical metals and their producing companies. In this
research, we create a novel framework, Dynamic Advisor-Based Ensemble (dynABE),
for stock prediction and use critical metal companies as case study. dynABE
uses domain knowledge to diversify the feature set by dividing them into
different ""advisors."" creates high-level ensembles with complex base models for
each advisor, and combines the advisors together dynamically during validation
with a novel and effective online update strategy. We test dynABE on three
cobalt-related companies, and it achieves the best-case misclassification error
of 31.12% and excess return of 477% compared to the stock itself in a year and
a half. In addition to presenting an effective stock prediction model with
decent profitabilities, this research further analyzes dynABE to visualize how
it works in practice, which also yields discoveries of its interesting
behaviors when processing time-series data.

20273,20274,Large-Scale Low-Rank Matrix Learning with Nonconvex Regularizers,"  Low-rank modeling has many important applications in computer vision and
machine learning. While the matrix rank is often approximated by the convex
nuclear norm, the use of nonconvex low-rank regularizers has demonstrated
better empirical performance. However, the resulting optimization problem is
much more challenging. Recent state-of-the-art requires an expensive full SVD
in each iteration. In this paper, we show that for many commonly-used nonconvex
low-rank regularizers, a cutoff can be derived to automatically threshold the
singular values obtained from the proximal operator. This allows such operator
being efficiently approximated by power method. Based on it, we develop a
proximal gradient algorithm (and its accelerated variant) with inexact proximal
splitting and prove that a convergence rate of O(1/T) where T is the number of
iterations is guaranteed. Furthermore, we show the proposed algorithm can be
well parallelized, which achieves nearly linear speedup w.r.t the number of
threads. Extensive experiments are performed on matrix completion and robust
principal component analysis, which shows a significant speedup over the
state-of-the-art. Moreover, the matrix solution obtained is more accurate and
has a lower rank than that of the nuclear norm regularizer.

the absence of zeros in a strip around the real axis. The matrix $G_{nm}$ must

5358,5359,Frequency analysis and the representation of slowly diffusing planetary solutions,"  Over short time intervals planetary ephemerides have been traditionally
represented in analytical form as finite sums of periodic terms or sums of
Poisson terms that are periodic terms with polynomial amplitudes. Nevertheless,
this representation is not well adapted for the evolution of the planetary
orbits in the solar system over million of years as they present drifts in
their main frequencies, due to the chaotic nature of their dynamics. The aim of
the present paper is to develop a numerical algorithm for slowly diffusing
solutions of a perturbed integrable Hamiltonian system that will apply to the
representation of the chaotic planetary motions with varying frequencies. By
simple analytical considerations, we first argue that it is possible to recover
exactly a single varying frequency. Then, a function basis involving
time-dependent fundamental frequencies is formulated in a semi-analytical way.
Finally, starting from a numerical solution, a recursive algorithm is used to
numerically decompose the solution on the significant elements of the function
basis. Simple examples show that this algorithm can be used to give compact
representations of different types of slowly diffusing solutions. As a test
example, we show how this algorithm can be successfully applied to obtain a
very compact approximation of the La2004 solution of the orbital motion of the
Earth over 40 Myr ([-35Myr,5Myr]). This example has been chosen as this
solution is widely used for the reconstruction of the climates of the past.

12070,12071,Fixed Price Approximability of the Optimal Gain From Trade,"  Bilateral trade is a fundamental economic scenario comprising a strategically
acting buyer and seller, each holding valuations for the item, drawn from
publicly known distributions. A mechanism is supposed to facilitate trade
between these agents, if such trade is beneficial. It was recently shown that
the only mechanisms that are simultaneously DSIC, SBB, and ex-post IR, are
fixed price mechanisms, i.e., mechanisms that are parametrised by a price p,
and trade occurs if and only if the valuation of the buyer is at least p and
the valuation of the seller is at most p. The gain from trade is the increase
in welfare that results from applying a mechanism; here we study the gain from
trade achievable by fixed price mechanisms. We explore this question for both
the bilateral trade setting, and a double auction setting where there are
multiple buyers and sellers. We first identify a fixed price mechanism that
achieves a gain from trade of at least 2/r times the optimum, where r is the
probability that the seller's valuation does not exceed the buyer's valuation.
This extends a previous result by McAfee. Subsequently, we improve this
approximation factor in an asymptotic sense, by showing that a more
sophisticated rule for setting the fixed price results in an expected gain from
trade within a factor O(log(1/r)) of the optimal gain from trade. This is
asymptotically the best approximation factor possible. Lastly, we extend our
study of fixed price mechanisms to the double auction setting defined by a set
of multiple i.i.d. unit demand buyers, and i.i.d. unit supply sellers. We
present a fixed price mechanism that achieves a gain from trade that achieves
for all epsilon > 0 a gain from trade of at least (1-epsilon) times the
expected optimal gain from trade with probability 1 - 2/e^{#T epsilon^2 /2},
where #T is the expected number of trades resulting from the double auction.

vacuum, and offset polar cap (PC) dipole $B$-fields (the latter is
characterized by a parameter $\epsilon$), in conjunction with standard two-pole
caustic (TPC) and outer gap (OG) emission geometries. The offset-PC dipole
$B$-field mimics deviations from the static dipole (which corresponds to
$\epsilon=0$). In addition to constant-emissivity geometric models, we also
considered a slot gap (SG) $E$-field associated with the offset-PC dipole
$B$-field and found that its inclusion leads to qualitatively different light
curves. Solving the particle transport equation shows that the particle energy
only becomes large enough to yield significant curvature radiation at large
altitudes above the stellar surface, given this relatively low $E$-field.
Therefore, particles do not always attain the radiation-reaction limit. Our
overall optimal light curve fit is for the retarded vacuum dipole field and OG
model, at an inclination angle $\alpha=78{_{-1}^{+1}}^{\circ}$ and observer
angle $\zeta=69{_{-1}^{+2}}^{\circ}$. For this $B$-field, the TPC model is
statistically disfavored compared to the OG model. For the static dipole field,
neither model is significantly preferred. We found that smaller values of
$\epsilon$ are favored for the offset-PC dipole field when assuming constant
emissivity, and larger $\epsilon$ values favored for variable emissivity, but
not significantly so. When multiplying the SG $E$-field by a factor of 100, we
found improved light curve fits, with $\alpha$ and $\zeta$ being closer to best
fits from independent studies, as well as curvature radiation reaction at lower
altitudes.

12469,12470,Deep Image Prior,"  Deep convolutional networks have become a popular tool for image generation
and restoration. Generally, their excellent performance is imputed to their
ability to learn realistic image priors from a large number of example images.
In this paper, we show that, on the contrary, the structure of a generator
network is sufficient to capture a great deal of low-level image statistics
prior to any learning. In order to do so, we show that a randomly-initialized
neural network can be used as a handcrafted prior with excellent results in
standard inverse problems such as denoising, super-resolution, and inpainting.
Furthermore, the same prior can be used to invert deep neural representations
to diagnose them, and to restore images based on flash-no flash input pairs.
Apart from its diverse applications, our approach highlights the inductive
bias captured by standard generator network architectures. It also bridges the
gap between two very popular families of image restoration methods:
learning-based methods using deep convolutional networks and learning-free
methods based on handcrafted image priors such as self-similarity. Code and

Trees, as a special class of graphs, have been the focus of several papers
and, recently, He and He~\cite{mt:4} showed how to produce a monotone drawing
of an arbitrary $n$-vertex tree that is contained in a $12n \times 12n$ grid.
All monotone tree drawing algorithms that have appeared in the literature
consider rooted ordered trees and they draw them so that (i) the root of the
tree is drawn at the origin of the drawing, (ii) the drawing is confined in the
first quadrant, and (iii) the ordering/embedding of the tree is respected. In
this paper, we provide a simple algorithm that has the exact same
characteristics and, given an $n$-vertex rooted tree $T$, it outputs a monotone
drawing of $T$ that fits on a $n \times n$ grid.
For unrooted ordered trees, we present an algorithms that produces monotone
drawings that respect the ordering and fit in an $(n+1) \times (\frac{n}{2}

of good aspect ratio which fit on a grid of size at most $\left\lfloor

13477,13478,Natural Time Analysis of Seismicity in California: The epicenter of an impending mainshock,"  Upon employing the analysis in a new time domain, termed natural time, it has
been recently demonstrated that a remarkable change of seismicity emerges
before major mainshocks in California. What constitutes this change is that the
fluctuations of the order parameter of seismicity exhibit a clearly detectable
minimum. This is identified by using a natural time window sliding event by
event through the time series of the earthquakes in a wide area and comprising
a number of events that would occur on the average within a few months or so.
Here, we suggest a method to estimate the epicentral area of an impending
mainshock by an additional study of this minimum using an area window sliding
through the wide area. We find that when this area window surrounds (or is
adjacent to) the future epicentral area, the minimum of the order parameter
fluctuations in this area appears at a date very close to the one at which the
minimum is observed in the wide area. The method is applied here to major
earthquakes that occurred in California during the recent decades including the
largest one, i.e., the 1992 Landers earthquake.

10059,10060,Epidemic dynamics in open quantum spin systems,"  We explore the non-equilibrium evolution and stationary states of an open
many-body system which displays epidemic spreading dynamics in a classical and
a quantum regime. Our study is motivated by recent experiments conducted in
strongly interacting gases of highly excited Rydberg atoms where the
facilitated excitation of Rydberg states competes with radiative decay. These
systems approximately implement open quantum versions of models for population
dynamics or disease spreading where species can be in a healthy, infected or
immune state. We show that in a two-dimensional lattice, depending on the
dominance of either classical or quantum effects, the system may display a
different kind of non-equilibrium phase transition. We moreover discuss the
observability of our findings in laser driven Rydberg gases with particular
focus on the role of long-range interactions.

14933,14934,In Search of Lost (Mixing) Time: Adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo schemes for Bayesian variable selection with very large p,"  The availability of data sets with large numbers of variables is rapidly
increasing. The effective application of Bayesian variable selection methods
for regression with these data sets has proved difficult since available Markov
chain Monte Carlo methods do not perform well in typical problem sizes of
interest. The current paper proposes new adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo
algorithms to address this shortcoming. The adaptive design of these algorithms
exploits the observation that in large $p$ small $n$ settings, the majority of
the $p$ variables will be approximately uncorrelated a posteriori. The
algorithms adaptively build suitable non-local proposals that result in moves
with squared jumping distance significantly larger than standard methods. Their
performance is studied empirically in high-dimension problems (with both
simulated and actual data) and speedups of up to 4 orders of magnitude are
observed. The proposed algorithms are easily implementable on multi-core
architectures and are well suited for parallel tempering or sequential Monte
Carlo implementations.

16017,16018,A Game Theoretic Macroscopic Model of Bypassing at Traffic Diverges with Applications to Mixed Autonomy Networks,"  Vehicle bypassing is known to negatively affect delays at traffic diverges.
However, due to the complexities of this phenomenon, accurate and yet simple
models of such lane change maneuvers are hard to develop. In this work, we
present a macroscopic model for predicting the number of vehicles that bypass
at a traffic diverge. We take into account the selfishness of vehicles in
selecting their lanes; every vehicle selects lanes such that its own cost is
minimized. We discuss how we model the costs experienced by the vehicles. Then,
taking into account the selfish behavior of the vehicles, we model the lane
choice of vehicles at a traffic diverge as a Wardrop equilibrium. We state and
prove the properties of Wardrop equilibrium in our model. We show that there
always exists an equilibrium for our model. Moreover, unlike most nonlinear
asymmetrical routing games, we prove that the equilibrium is unique under mild
assumptions. We discuss how our model can be easily calibrated by running a
simple optimization problem. Using our calibrated model, we validate it through
simulation studies and demonstrate that our model successfully predicts the
aggregate lane change maneuvers that are performed by vehicles for bypassing at
a traffic diverge. We further discuss how our model can be employed to obtain
the optimal lane choice behavior of the vehicles, where the social or total
cost of vehicles is minimized. Finally, we demonstrate how our model can be
utilized in scenarios where a central authority can dictate the lane choice and
trajectory of certain vehicles so as to increase the overall vehicle mobility
at a traffic diverge. Examples of such scenarios include the case when both
human driven and autonomous vehicles coexist in the network. We show how
certain decisions of the central authority can affect the total delays in such
scenarios via an example.

8668,8669,Structured Variational Inference for Coupled Gaussian Processes,"  Sparse variational approximations allow for principled and scalable inference
in Gaussian Process (GP) models. In settings where several GPs are part of the
generative model, theses GPs are a posteriori coupled. For many applications
such as regression where predictive accuracy is the quantity of interest, this
coupling is not crucial. Howewer if one is interested in posterior uncertainty,
it cannot be ignored. A key element of variational inference schemes is the
choice of the approximate posterior parameterization. When the number of latent
variables is large, mean field (MF) methods provide fast and accurate posterior
means while more structured posterior lead to inference algorithm of greater
computational complexity. Here, we extend previous sparse GP approximations and
propose a novel parameterization of variational posteriors in the multi-GP
setting allowing for fast and scalable inference capturing posterior
dependencies.

5768,5769,Wormholes and masses for Goldstone bosons,"  There exist non-trivial stationary points of the Euclidean action for an
axion particle minimally coupled to Einstein gravity, dubbed wormholes. They
explicitly break the continuos global shift symmetry of the axion in a
non-perturbative way, and generate an effective potential that may compete with
QCD depending on the value of the axion decay constant. In this paper, we
explore both theoretical and phenomenological aspects of this issue. On the
theory side, we address the problem of stability of the wormhole solutions, and
we show that the spectrum of the quadratic action features only positive
eigenvalues. On the phenomenological side, we discuss, beside the obvious
application to the QCD axion, relevant consequences for models with ultralight
dark matter, black hole superradiance, and the relaxation of the electroweak
scale. We conclude discussing wormhole solutions for a generic coset and the
potential they generate.

2545,2546,Unconditional bases of subspaces related to non-self-adjoint perturbations of self-adjoint operators,"  Assume that $T$ is a self-adjoint operator on a Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$
and that the spectrum of $T$ is confined in the union $\bigcup_{j\in
J}\Delta_j$, $J\subseteq\mathbb{Z}$, of segments $\Delta_j=[\alpha_j,
\beta_j]\subset\mathbb{R}$ such that $\alpha_{j+1}>\beta_j$ and $$ \inf_{j}
\left(\alpha_{j+1}-\beta_j\right) = d > 0. $$ If $B$ is a bounded (in general
non-self-adjoint) perturbation of $T$ with $\|B\|=:b<d/2$ then the spectrum of
the perturbed operator $A=T+B$ lies in the union $\bigcup_{j\in J}
U_{b}(\Delta_j)$ of the mutually disjoint closed $b$-neighborhoods
$U_{b}(\Delta_j)$ of the segments $\Delta_j$ in $\mathbb{C}$. Let $Q_j$ be the
Riesz projection onto the invariant subspace of $A$ corresponding to the part
of the spectrum of $A$ lying in $U_{b}\left(\Delta_j\right)$, $j\in J$. Our
main result is as follows: The subspaces $\mathcal{L}_j=Q_j(\mathcal H)$, $j\in
J$, form an unconditional basis in the whole space $\mathcal H$.
