This also creates confusion about how to communicate these credentials on the part of the producers, as distinctions must be made in order to avoid consumer misunderstanding. And it’ s no secret that winemakers need to nail their brand communication and labeling when it comes to such credentials.
According to research by the Pew Research Center, 71% ​ of Americans make purchasing decisions based on nutrition and ingredients labels. In addition, 68% of Americans have purchased organic food products within the past month - a number which is growing due to the number of perceived benefits​ of organic products.
Let’ s take a look into how brands can best convey the credentials of each of these categories in order to maintain consumer confidence and make their brand messaging clear.
'Organic wine often comes from smaller winemakers as it's difficult to produce in volume. Champion this - it should be clear to consumers that they are supporting a smaller business '
Producing organic wines sets a lot of brands apart from the competition, and the demand is growing. By 2022, more than one billion​ bottles of organic wine are expected to be consumed globally.
Organic wine often comes from smaller winemakers, since it’ s notoriously difficult​ to produce in volume. It’ s also very dependent on the region and producer, so while competition is growing, there are still certain points of differentiation between organic wine brands. Small organic winemakers should make their voices heard by championing this aspect of their brand: It should be clear to consumers that they are supporting a smaller business that’ s dedicated to the practice.
Organic winemakers must be inherently passionate about their product, as it doesn’ t necessarily result in better profit margins than traditional winemaking due to the risky nature of a harvest with no pesticides. They can convey this passion clearly in their brand messaging and on the label by telling the story behind the winery and creating a narrative around the product.
Organic wine brands can also leverage a number of official certifications to gain consumer confidence. In the US, they can apply to be USDA Organic​ certified. In the EU​ they can be certified as “ organic wine ” if they are made with organically grown grapes, all organic additives, and no GMOs, with sulfur additions limited to 100 parts per million ( ppm) in red wines and 150 ppm in white or rosé wines.
Sustainability in wine not only refers to ecologically sound vineyards and production methods but also socially responsible and economically viable practices. Sustainable wine production involves practices like carbon sequestration, water conservation, and renewable energy usage, and is largely about reducing waste in winemaking.
Making sure they convey these efforts to practice sustainable winemaking is crucial for brands, especially as consumers grow to be increasingly eco-conscious. In fact, this Nielsen report​ states that `` Brands that are able to strategically connect ( sustainability) to actual behavior are in a good place to capitalize on increased consumer expectation and demand. '' It continues to explain that `` Sustainability claims on packaging must also reflect how a company operates inside and out. ''
In order to add legitimacy to their sustainability credentials, winemakers should get certified with whatever local certification is available. In the US, options include the Sustainability in Practice ( SIP) certification​, CERTIFIED SUSTAINABLE​, which is administered by the California Sustainable Winegrowing Alliance ( CSWA), and LIVE Certified​, which supports environmentally and socially responsible winegrowing. Internationally, winemakers can get certified by the EMS Environmental Management System ( ISO 14001/ISO 14004).
Narrative is also important. In addition to getting certified, sustainable winemakers should focus less on the how​ and more on the why​. Just as with organic wines, consumers are much more likely to connect to a story than a simple list of sustainable practices. Maybe something triggered the switch to environmentally-friendly methods, or efforts to alter other aspects of the producers’ lifestyle spilled over into winemaking practices. It’ s important that brands give their sustainability narrative a unique, personal edge to engage consumers.
And of course, brands should never underestimate the power of the label and the information it displays. While social media marketing and advertising campaigns will help reach people, displaying sustainability credentials loud and clear on the label is the only way to ensure every consumer understands the efforts being made. A non-traditional looking label that tells the brand story and shows how the company has broken from traditional winemaking practices to reduce its impact on the planet is the way forward.
Biodynamic wine is made with a focus on holistic agricultural health. It generally has a more niche set of consumers, as the vast majority are not well-aware of the intricacies of the techniques, which can often resemble witchcraft-like practices. ​
To avoid putting general customers off by trying to explain the complexity and reasoning behind these methods, biodynamic wine producers should focus on having a clear message that conveys the organic qualities of their product, their rejection of pesticides and GMOs, and the environmental benefits of the methods.
To connect with smaller groups of enthusiasts, brands can delve deeper into the specific techniques of biodynamic winemaking by publishing detailed blog posts on their website. Current official certifications for biodynamic wines include Demeter​ in the US and Biodyvin ​in Europe.
It goes without saying that marketing organic, sustainability, or biodynamic credentials is only going to be effective if the message falls on the right ears.
Receptiveness to these credentials will vary wildly across geographical regions, so it’ s crucial that winemakers get to know their audience.
For example, in China, wine is already seen as inherently healthy. The vast majority of consumers are not yet focused on sustainable or organic practices, so promoting this message here to drive sales may be a little tougher.
On the contrary, in New Zealand, organic winemaking has become the norm. Here, producers should be sure to shout their message loud and clear. Europe and North America are somewhere in the middle: Organic and sustainable wines are growing in popularity, especially with socially and environmentally conscious millennials.
Ultimately, effectively communicating a given method of winemaking will come naturally to producers that are true to their practice and carry it out with passion and a love for the product. But that’ s not to say there aren’ t ways to maximize consumer connection. In order to achieve this, winemakers should make sure to craft a narrative, add legitimacy with an official certification, and focus on conveying the why​ of the chosen methods.

846,Coronavirus Outbreak Sours Japan on Chinese Tourist Boom,"TOKYO — Just as Japan and China have been taking tentative steps toward moving past old animosities, a fast-spreading virus threatens to push them apart.
A deadly coronavirus outbreak in China, which has spawned fears of a pandemic across Asia, is raising concern in Japan that public sentiment could be damaged as Chinese citizens have become an increasingly visible part of daily life.
The alarm over the virus is unlikely to hurt formal government relations. After years of mounting tensions over history and territory, the two largest Asian economies have been drawing closer, with Japan planning a state visit for the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, this spring.
But with the start of the weeklong Lunar New Year holiday ushering in one of the busiest travel seasons for Chinese tourists, some Japanese say they can not help but regard Chinese visitors warily. It is a view shared in many Asian countries that have experienced an influx of Chinese tourists — and their money — in recent years.
“ I’ m worried about the epidemic spreading here, ” said Naho Imajima, 34, who works at a tobacco shop in the Kabukicho entertainment district in Tokyo, which is popular with Chinese visitors. “ Even people who cough, most of them aren’ t wearing masks. It could just be a cold, but I never know. I get nervous when a foreign tourist passes by and they’ re coughing. ”
Chinese travelers have fueled a tourism boom in Japan, increasing fourfold in the last five years to more than 9.5 million annually, and now representing about a third of all foreign visitors. In addition, more Chinese students are enrolling in Japanese universities, and in some cases they make up a majority in graduate programs.
Many shops and restaurants around Japan now cater to Chinese travelers, posting signs in Chinese and accepting payment systems from China like Alipay or WeChat Pay.
But after two visitors from Wuhan, the epicenter of the new outbreak, were hospitalized in Japan for coronavirus infections over the past week, nerves have been on edge.
This month, a shop owner in Hakone, a popular hot-springs resort town, posted a sign reading, “ Chinese are not allowed to enter the store. ” A photo of it was widely shared on social media in both Japan and China, and some began to wonder if the new coronavirus would amplify an anti-Chinese undercurrent that persists in Japan.
Others applauded the shop owner’ s move, saying that Chinese tourists often exhibited “ bad manners, ” a common theme in online complaints and news reports.
Masanari Iida, a former candidate for public office in Kanagawa Prefecture, argued on Twitter that the owner was acting in “ self-defense. ”
“ I don’ t understand why this is a problem, ” Mr. Iida wrote. “ The store has a right to choose its customers. ”
Fears have spiraled across Asia as China reported that the virus has caused at least 41 deaths and sickened nearly 1,300 people. The Chinese government has put a dozen cities in the central part of the country on a travel lockdown, effectively corralling 35 million residents.
The Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, said on Friday that Japan would increase efforts to quarantine visitors who showed symptoms of the coronavirus. The government also recommended that Japanese citizens refrain from visiting Wuhan for “ unnecessary or nonurgent trips. ”
All Nippon Airways canceled all flights to and from Wuhan until Feb. 1. JalPak, a package tour operator owned by Japan Airlines, said that 50 customers had canceled trips to China in the past week because of news of the virus.
At a cabinet meeting, Mr. Abe said he hoped that the public would not “ worry excessively ” and would act calmly, and he called for people to take the same precautions that they would for the common cold, including washing their hands and wearing surgical masks.
With tourism from China such an important segment of the Japanese economy, some business owners said they did not want the coronavirus to affect views of customers from China.
“ Seeing the news, we worry about the disease a little, but I can not say ‘ please don’ t come,’ ” said Setsuko Yoshizawa, 70, the owner of a shop in the Tokyo district of Asakusa, the site of a temple that is often mobbed with Chinese tourists. “ We can not survive without customers visiting us. I welcome Chinese visitors. ”
Japanese public sentiment about China has improved since the lows seen when the two countries were locked in an intense territorial dispute over islands in the East China Sea, but it is still not terribly high.

Touching contaminated objects and then infecting ourselves with the germs is not typically how the virus spreads. But it can happen. A number of studies of flu, rhinovirus, coronavirus and other microbes have shown that respiratory illnesses, including the new coronavirus, can spread by touching contaminated surfaces, particularly in places like day care centers, offices and hospitals. But a long chain of events has to happen for the disease to spread that way. The best way to protect yourself from coronavirus — whether it’ s surface transmission or close human contact — is still social distancing, washing your hands, not touching your face and wearing masks.
So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited paper published in April suggests that people are most infectious about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms. Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have symptoms was “ very rare, ” but she later walked back that statement.
A study by European scientists is the first to document a strong statistical link between genetic variations and Covid-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus. Having Type A blood was linked to a 50 percent increase in the likelihood that a patient would need to get oxygen or to go on a ventilator, according to the new study.
The unemployment rate fell to 13.3 percent in May, the Labor Department said on June 5, an unexpected improvement in the nation’ s job market as hiring rebounded faster than economists expected. Economists had forecast the unemployment rate to increase to as much as 20 percent, after it hit 14.7 percent in April, which was the highest since the government began keeping official statistics after World War II. But the unemployment rate dipped instead, with employers adding 2.5 million jobs, after more than 20 million jobs were lost in April.
Mass protests against police brutality that have brought thousands of people onto the streets in cities across America are raising the specter of new coronavirus outbreaks, prompting political leaders, physicians and public health experts to warn that the crowds could cause a surge in cases. While many political leaders affirmed the right of protesters to express themselves, they urged the demonstrators to wear face masks and maintain social distancing, both to protect themselves and to prevent further community spread of the virus. Some infectious disease experts were reassured by the fact that the protests were held outdoors, saying the open air settings could mitigate the risk of transmission.
Exercise researchers and physicians have some blunt advice for those of us aiming to return to regular exercise now: Start slowly and then rev up your workouts, also slowly. American adults tended to be about 12 percent less active after the stay-at-home mandates began in March than they were in January. But there are steps you can take to ease your way back into regular exercise safely. First, “ start at no more than 50 percent of the exercise you were doing before Covid, ” says Dr. Monica Rho, the chief of musculoskeletal medicine at the Shirley Ryan AbilityLab in Chicago. Thread in some preparatory squats, too, she advises. “ When you haven’ t been exercising, you lose muscle mass. ” Expect some muscle twinges after these preliminary, post-lockdown sessions, especially a day or two later. But sudden or increasing pain during exercise is a clarion call to stop and return home.
States are reopening bit by bit. This means that more public spaces are available for use and more and more businesses are being allowed to open again. The federal government is largely leaving the decision up to states, and some state leaders are leaving the decision up to local authorities. Even if you aren’ t being told to stay at home, it’ s still a good idea to limit trips outside and your interaction with other people.
Common symptoms include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath. Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less common. The C.D.C. has also added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.
If air travel is unavoidable, there are some steps you can take to protect yourself. Most important: Wash your hands often, and stop touching your face. If possible, choose a window seat. A study from Emory University found that during flu season, the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window, as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people. Disinfect hard surfaces. When you get to your seat and your hands are clean, use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest, the seatbelt buckle, the remote, screen, seat back pocket and the tray table. If the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather, you can wipe that down, too. ( Using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them.)
Taking one’ s temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds, as “ normal ” temperature numbers can vary, but generally, keep an eye out for a temperature of 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit or higher. If you don’ t have a thermometer ( they can be pricey these days), there are other ways to figure out if you have a fever, or are at risk of Covid-19 complications.
The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now, the C.D.C., like the W.H.O., has advised that ordinary people don’ t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’ t replace hand washing and social distancing.
If you’ ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have, and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested, how to get tested, and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others.
If you’ re sick and you think you’ ve been exposed to the new coronavirus, the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’ s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’ re asymptomatic, for instance — you won’ t be able to get tested.
According to an annual survey by Japan’ s central cabinet office, just over 5 percent of those polled in 2014 said they felt “ an affinity with China. ” Last year, the figure was about 23 percent.
Komaki Lee, a Chinese-born naturalized Japanese citizen who has twice run unsuccessfully for public office, said he had often experienced discrimination because of his Chinese heritage.
When he was a candidate four years ago and again last year, he said, people defaced his campaign posters with the words “ Go home! ” or trolled him with similar sentiments online or in person.
“ Now it’ s the season for a lot of Chinese tourists to visit Japan, and there is this pandemic happening, ” Mr. Lee said. “ So I think that Japanese people will try to avoid Chinese people more, and I think that’ s when discrimination might worsen. ”
Still, the more hostile strains of anti-Chinese expression in Japan are met with pushback. When Tsuyoshi Iida tried to run for office in Kanagawa last year, his party declined to endorse him because its leaders said he had repeatedly posted hate speech online directed at Chinese and Koreans.
This month, the University of Tokyo fired an associate professor of artificial intelligence, Shohei Ohsawa, who made anti-Chinese comments on Twitter, including saying that he would never hire Chinese students at a company for which he was doing research.
Japanese attitudes about China may be shaped more by criticism of the Chinese government than its people, said Atsushi Kondo, a professor of immigration policy studies at Meijo University in Nagoya.
“ More people question human rights and democracy over the Chinese government’ s policy against the Uighurs or Hong Kong, ” said Mr. Kondo, referring to the Chinese government’ s detention of Muslim ethnic minorities in internment camps and its repression of the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong.
“ There might be some cases where some people experience trouble over the manners of tourists and have bad feelings, ” Mr. Kondo added. “ But I don’ t think anti-Chinese sentiment is growing in general. ”

544,"Wuhan, Center of Coronavirus Outbreak, Is Being Cut Off by Chinese Authorities","BEIJING — Chinese authorities on Thursday morning closed off Wuhan — a city of more than 11 million people and the epicenter of a pneumonia-like virus that has spread halfway around the world — by canceling planes and trains leaving the city, and suspending buses, subways and ferries within it.
The announcement, shared on Chinese state media just hours before it was to take effect, was a significant escalation from just the day before, when the authorities had urged people not to travel to or from the central Chinese city but had stopped short of shutting down transportation.
The new virus, which first emerged at the end of December, has killed at least 17 people and sickened more than 570, including in Taiwan, Japan, Thailand, South Korea and the United States. It has raised the specter of a repeat of the SARS epidemic, which broke out in China in 2002 and 2003 and spread rapidly while officials obscured the seriousness of the crisis. That virus eventually killed more than 800 people worldwide.
The virus has sickened tens of thousands of people in China and a number of other countries.
In recent days, governments around the world have introduced special screening measures at ports of entry, and the World Health Organization is weighing the declaration of an international emergency.
The Chinese authorities said that the measures in Wuhan were needed to “ effectively cut off the transmission of the virus, resolutely curb the spread of the epidemic, and ensure the safety and health of the people. ”
They said they would later announce an end date for the restrictions.
The news spread quickly. On Sina Weibo, a Twitter-like Chinese social media site, the hashtag # WuhanLockdown was the top trending topic, with more than 1.6 million views.
Chinese users left comments on the government’ s announcement expressing support for the lockdown and concern for the residents of the city. “ Go Wuhan, ” several posted.
Others wondered how sick residents would get from their homes to hospitals without public transportation. Some who said they lived in Wuhan asked what would happen to them.
“ Who will think of the lives of those of us who are healthy in Wuhan? We are also afraid, ” wrote one user, who described herself as a designer living in Wuhan. “ Even before the city was closed, we protected ourselves and hid at home. Now we are lambs who will still be slaughtered, and we can only leave our fates to the heavens. ”
Extreme measures during outbreaks have been imposed elsewhere before. During the Ebola epidemic in West Africa in 2014, Sierra Leone ordered everyone in the nation to stay home for three days as the authorities went door-to-door checking for new cases, retrieving dead bodies and trying to stop the disease from spreading further. In Monrovia, the capital of Liberia, a sprawling neighborhood with tens of thousands of people was put under strict quarantine by the government and guarded by police officers in riot gear, setting off violent clashes with penned-in residents.
During the 2003 SARS outbreak, anyone in China who displayed symptoms of the disease was hospitalized, and students were examined daily. In Singapore, people suspected of having SARS were confined to their homes and monitored with webcams and electronic bracelets.
Still, medical experts were startled by the scale of the shutdown in Wuhan, which has more people than the entire country of Sierra Leone. Dr. Tom Inglesby, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said that a city the size of Wuhan has “ tens of thousands of connections with the outside world that are coming and going all the time, bringing food and medicine. ”
” The complexity and downside cost of that will be potentially very high, ” Dr. Inglesby said.
Roughly 30,000 people fly out of Wuhan on an average day, according to air traffic data analyzed by researchers at Northeastern University in Boston. Many more leave using ground transportation like trains and cars. The city is the hub of industry and commerce in central China, home to the region’ s biggest airport and deep-water port and sometimes known as the Chicago of China. It is popular among tourists for its colonial architecture, spicy noodles and proximity to the Yangtze River.
In the short term, the sudden restrictions could upend the travel plans of millions of Chinese citizens, who travel in huge numbers during the Lunar New Year holiday, which begins on Friday. The government said it would close Wuhan’ s airport and train stations to departures, and it urged residents not to leave the city — a major transportation hub — unless they had an urgent reason to do so.
The Lunar New Year in China is typically the world’ s largest annual migration of people, with hundreds of millions of travelers fanning out across the country and the world, and hundreds of billions of dollars spent on hotels, restaurants and shopping. Before the virus emerged, the Chinese government had estimated that domestic travelers would make three billion trips over the holiday period, also known as the Spring Festival.
But with the new coronavirus, the mass migration is also an epidemiologist’ s nightmare.
On Wednesday, a senior Chinese health official delivered a stark warning: The tide of travel during the holiday would make it more difficult to contain the outbreak.
In addition, “ the possibility exists that the virus could mutate, and there are risks that the epidemic could spread further, ” said the official, Li Bin, a deputy head of China’ s health commission. Chinese officials had already classified the virus as a class B infectious disease, a category that includes SARS.
Before the transportation shutdown, the Wuhan government had also issued a ban on large public gatherings and performances at hotels and sightseeing destinations. They had announced that all locals were required to wear masks in public to help prevent the spread of the virus.
Tour companies had promised penalty-free refunds for hotel bookings and air and train tickets to and from the city. Travel operators had suspended itineraries with stops there.
Outside of Wuhan, many Chinese have also already canceled travel plans, forgoing vacations and what for some is their only chance to return home for family reunions during the year.
“ After we heard how bad the situation was on Monday, we held a family meeting and decided that it just wasn’ t worth the risk, ” said Yan Chaowei, 32, a Shanghai resident who was planning on taking a seven-hour bullet train to her family home in southeastern Jiangxi Province.

Over 38 million people have filed for unemployment since March. One in five who were working in February reported losing a job or being furloughed in March or the beginning of April, data from a Federal Reserve survey released on May 14 showed, and that pain was highly concentrated among low earners. Fully 39 percent of former workers living in a household earning $ 40,000 or less lost work, compared with 13 percent in those making more than $ 100,000, a Fed official said.
If air travel is unavoidable, there are some steps you can take to protect yourself. Most important: Wash your hands often, and stop touching your face. If possible, choose a window seat.

There is an uptick in people reporting symptoms of chilblains, which are painful red or purple lesions that typically appear in the winter on fingers or toes. The lesions are emerging as yet another symptom of infection with the new coronavirus. Chilblains are caused by inflammation in small blood vessels in reaction to cold or damp conditions, but they are usually common in the coldest winter months. Federal health officials do not include toe lesions in the list of coronavirus symptoms, but some dermatologists are pushing for a change, saying so-called Covid toe should be sufficient grounds for testing.
Yes, but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’ t live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park, rather than go for a jog or a walk, getting some fresh air, and hopefully sunshine, is a good idea.
Taking one’ s temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds, as “ normal ” temperature numbers can vary, but generally, keep an eye out for a temperature of 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit or higher.

Charity Navigator, which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system, has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross, and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities.
“ It just wouldn’ t be a relaxing trip, especially with a small child, ” she added. “ When we finally made the decision to stay home, we sighed with relief. ”
For Chinese companies, the outbreak could deal yet another blow at a time of slowing economic growth. According to official estimates, Chinese spent $ 74 billion on travel and $ 145 billion on shopping and food during the Spring Festival holiday last year.
But this week, the Taiwanese president, Tsai Ing-wen, said that all travel by tour groups between Wuhan and Taiwan would be suspended. North Korea also temporarily banned foreign tourists, many of whom come from China, according to a leading tour operator.
Some international health experts, including the World Health Organization, have praised the Chinese government’ s response as timely.
But the government, particularly in Wuhan, has drawn public criticism at home for what some see as a delay in the reporting of cases that evoked the memory of the SARS outbreak, in which the Chinese government withheld critical information. A top committee of the ruling Communist Party warned officials on Tuesday in a social media post that anyone who sought to hide infections would be “ forever nailed to history’ s pillar of shame. ”
And new cases were continuing to emerge. In Mexico, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said Wednesday morning that the Mexican health authorities had identified a possible case in the northern state of Tamaulipas. The patient was “ under observation, ” the president said during a news conference. Gloria Molina, the health secretary for the state of Tamaulipas, said that the patient is a 57-year-old researcher in a university biotechnology laboratory who had visited Wuhan recently and works in Reynosa, a border town near McAllen, Texas.
Despite the spread of the virus, some experts are urging the public to remain calm.
“ This is a SARS-like event but not as severe as SARS, ” said Wang Linfa, director of the emerging infectious disease program at Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore. “ During an outbreak like this from an unknown pathogen, overreacting might be better than underreacting, but we still have to be realistic. ”
Zhu Niancheng, 19, a chemistry major at a university in Wuhan, appeared to be heeding that advice on Wednesday as he sat on a suitcase outside a Beijing train station smoking a cigarette.
“ Don’ t worry, I’ m not going to Wuhan, ” he said, as a phalanx of People’ s Liberation Army soldiers in green uniforms and black face masks marched behind him.
Asked if he was concerned about his classmates back in Wuhan, the teenager laughed and said, “ I’ m not really afraid. We just make fun of each other on WeChat, like ‘ Yo, you still alive?’ ”

869,Dow Jones Industrial Average Drops After Another Coronavirus Case Found in U.S.,"2:35 p.m. The Dow Jones Industrial Average’ s 100-point gain at Friday’ s open has turned into a more than 200-point loss on reports of another case of coronavirus in the U.S.
The Dow has declined 283.37 points, or 1%, to 28,876.72, while the S & P 500 has fallen 1.2% to 3285.96 and the Nasdaq Composite has dropped 1.2% to 9,287.12.
Reports suggest that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is going to announce a third case of coronavirus in the U.S. It is also keeping an eye on 60 more people who may or may not have the illness. A second case has already been reported in Illinois.
The market hasn’ t been able to ignore that completely. And for good reason. The response to the outbreak in China has been massive, with a new hospital being built in Wuhan to deal with it, and some 40 million people under lockdown. Heck, even Shanghai Disneyland has been shut.
So perhaps reality is setting in about the impact the coronavirus will have on both the economy and the market “ We think it’ s going to freeze up a lot of travel and trade in Q1, ” writes Merion Capital Group’ s Richard Farr. “ And that’ s going to hit GDP worldwide. ”
The stock market has been betting on an earnings revival in 2020, with the hope being that earnings growth can help shrink it’ s valuation. It’ s just one more risk to add to the equation.",business
896,China's Citywide Quarantines: Are They Ethical and Effective?,"The novel coronavirus outbreak that apparently started in China’ s massive city of Wuhan has now spread to other parts of that nation and several countries beyond it, including the U.S. As of late this week, health officials said the virus had infected more than 1,000 people, causing at least 41 deaths in China. Chinese authorities have responded by shutting down all travel into and out of Wuhan and about a dozen other cities, restricting the movements of around 35 million people.
The restrictions—which are occurring during the Chinese New Year holiday, when millions of people usually travel to visit their families—are an attempt to prevent the virus from spreading further within China, where the vast majority of cases have so far been concentrated. But experts are split on whether this approach is effective or fair to the residents of the affected cities.
“ As far as I know, trying to completely cut out travel from an area of that size—if it’ s not unprecedented, it’ s close, ” says Chandy John, former president of the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene and a professor of pediatrics at Indiana University. “ I’ m not aware of anything that’ s been that drastic for [ such an area ] in the past. ”
The action raises a number of potential issues, including “ basic human rights concerns about restricting a group of people who are within an epidemic area to that area, ” John says. Additionally, “ if you do something like this, getting health supplies into the city, getting care for the people in the city who are sick—all of that’ s going to be more difficult. And of course, those who are in the city who aren’ t sick—and can’ t leave—may be more exposed than they would be if they could leave. ” The New York Times reported that people in Wuhan were experiencing long waits for medical care, that some were sent home without a thorough exam or treatment and that some residents had limited access to fresh food because so many shops and markets were closed. John says that in a city as large as Wuhan, which has a population of more than 11 million, some people may still find ways to leave. And they might not want to tell others where they are coming from, which could make it harder to trace potential infections.
On the other hand, John says, “ it is still relatively early in the outbreak, and so prevention of travel is one effective way of containing it to an area—especially since [ Wuhan ] seems to be a major hub for transport and travel in China. ” The travel shutdown lowers the risk of residents of Wuhan or nearby cities carrying the virus elsewhere, and it makes it less likely that people who visit will acquire the pathogen and spread it when they return home. “ From that standpoint, I think it could be effective in reducing the spread, ” John says. But something less draconian than restricting all travel—such as telling individuals with symptoms of the infection to stay in their home— “ could have a big bang for the buck without all the downsides of the travel restrictions, ” he says.
Other experts did not express the same qualms about the quarantines. “ Very few countries could pull it off. China is one of the ones that can, ” says Arthur Caplan, a bioethicist at New York University Grossman School of Medicine. But should they? “ My attitude here is yes, ” he says. “ We don’ t know whether this is a big risk or small risk, ” Caplan adds. “ Anytime you get a new mutation [ in a virus ], though, that looks like it’ s person-to-person and could be fatal due to pneumonia—I think that’ s something to pay immediate attention to. ” Furthermore, he says, “ it isn't particularly intrusive to be told you have to stay in a city of 11 million people—that's hardly being chained to your apartment... So I don’ t see this as some kind of gigantic civil liberties intrusion. I see it as prudent. ”
But quarantining an entire large city—or multiple cities—is not an approach that would work in many other places. “ You’ re not going to quarantine the city of New York, ever, ” Caplan says, noting that U.S. authorities could not even effectively enforce a quarantine imposed on one nurse who returned to the country after treating Ebola patients in Sierra Leone in 2014. Whether it is more effective to quarantine cities, as China has done, or to simply ask individuals who feel sick to stay home is a matter of culture, he says.
When a government decides to quarantine someone, it should ensure that those affected have a tolerable quality of life, Caplan says. If a person is kept in a room with no television, bad heat and no running water, for example, that is unacceptable. But not allowing someone to leave a city of 11 million is “ not especially burdensome, ” he says—at least until more is known about the virus and how lethal it is.
A second U.S. case of the new coronavirus was confirmed on Friday in Illinois. Cases of human-to-human transmission have been reported in China, including chains of up to four people. Most of those who died were older and had underlying health problems. So far, the World Health Organization has declined to declare the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern, although it has said that decision could change as more information becomes available.",science
32,Patent Pending: Is warehousing Alphabet's next moonshot?,"This is Patent Pending. Supply chain-related patent applications are published every day and this is where we 'll talk about the ones that could have the biggest impact on the supply chain and the ones that challenge the norm. ​We want to give you an idea of where supply chains are heading and what the industry is thinking. Read the last issue here.
X Development isn't modest. Its website calls the research company Alphabet's `` Moonshot Factory. '' And, to be fair, the company is behind some of Alphabet's most ambitious initiatives from Project Wing to Waymo. Recent patent applications from the company hint at another supply-chain-oriented focus: warehouse automation.
The X team envisions a warehouse with autonomous pallet jacks and real-time inventory counts. A warehouse control system ( WCS) choreographs the systems of sensors and robotics, according to a patent application published this week. The network would track the real-time location of pallets and the inventory count of items stored on pallets.
One method would track inventory with automated guided vehicles that would use cameras to navigate and collect information, according to a second patent application.
Information on inventory location could also allow the system to create more density within the warehouse. It could determine if two or more pallets of inventory could be condensed to a single pallet and also determine the location of the robotic devices needed for the job.
The backroom of a retail store can eat into floor space. But a patent application from Walmart published this week shows a potential alternative: build up, not out.
Inventory is stored above a drop ceiling at a retail store. A fleet of robotic vehicles would ferry inventory between attic space and the retail floor using access points and a rail system.
The system of rails would allow the vehicle to travel vertically and horizontally across the inventory rack space until it reaches the desired inventory. The storage space could be subdivided based on factors like temperature or other inventory requirements. Sensors, including RFID or cameras, could be used to determine the location of the inventory on its journey to ground level.
Drone delivery started to showpromise in 2019 with the first commercial drone deliveries. But a patent application published this week raises a question: Has the process been perfected?
This patent suggests a new way drones can carry and drop off parcels: a vacuum. `` The invention can be used for fun or ordinary deliveries of pizza, boxed fast food, medical supplies to homes or businesses, '' the description explains.
This would require a pump and a motor and drones are already limited in their flight time based on their battery capacity. If this invention does find a home it might be for short-range jobs.

719,Coronavirus Has Hit the Stock Market. Here’ s What History Says Comes Next.,"The outbreak of pneumonia in China’ s Wuhan province is caused by a coronavirus that usually infects animals but can jump to humans. The first case of the Wuhan virus in the U.S. was confirmed on Tuesday.
The growing number of cases has travel-related stocks down. China Eastern Airlines ( ticker: CEA), for instance, is down about 13% over the past five days.
On the other hand, Lakeland Industries ( LAKE), a small-capitalization company that makes personal protective equipment used by health-care professions, is up more than 25%.
Investors don’ t like volatility, but they have had to deal with disease-related shocks in the past. History says the impact will be temporary.
Read Next: The Dow Could Hit 30,000 Five Years Ahead of Schedule. It Won’ t Stop There.
“ Past experience of market performance around such events suggests that markets tend to bottom with the peak in new cases and news flow. ” J.P. Morgan Asia equity and quantitative strategist Mixo Das wrote in a Wednesday research report.
That’ s good news. A small, short-term impact is what market participants hope happens this time.
“ Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses, some causing respiratory illness in people, ” reads the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention news release reviewing the confirmed U.S. infection. “ Rarely, animal coronaviruses can evolve and infect people and then spread between people, such as has been seen with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome ( SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome ( MERS). ”
SARS infected more than 8,000 people in 2003, killing more than 770. The outbreak occurred between November 2002 and July 2003.
Stocks of U.S. airlines—a proxy for travel-related shares—dropped more than 30% from pre-SARS highs during that outbreak, about twice the decline of the broader S & P 500 index. All stocks, it appears, were impacted by the outbreak. It took about three months for shares to bottom and another three month to achieve previous highs.
Travel is often the sector investors focus on when disease fears rise. China, for instance, is recommending that people not travel ahead of the Lunar New Year celebrations.
The “ Ebola virus outbreak helps frame potential [ airline pricing ] impact from coronavirus, ” wrote Stifel airline analyst Joseph DeNardi in a Wednesday research report. Reported cases of Ebola—another deadly virus—spiked in 2014, creating volatility for investors again.
It wasn’ t just uncertainty that moved stock prices back then. The outbreak impacted airline fundamentals. There were fewer travelers and prices declined. Looking ahead, DeNardi estimates that, if airline pricing from the U.S. to Asia behaves as it did in 2014, 10% to 45% of full year U.S. airline earnings could vanish. That is a big impact.
United Airlines Holdings ( UAL) and Hawaiian Holdings ( HA) have the most Asian exposure. Delta Air Lines ( DAL) and American Airlines Group ( AAL) have less exposure, according to the analyst.
This isn’ t a prediction by DeNardi, only a scenario analysis. And not every stock is negatively affected by disease fears. Traders historically have bid up shares of some health-care companies when disease outbreaks occur.
Lakeland, for instance, jumped by almost six times after the 2014 Ebola problems came to light. Shares, however, fell back to earth relatively quickly.
Looking far back into the past, the Spanish flu was the “ most severe pandemic in recent history, ” according to the CDC. About 500 million people were infected and 50 million people died. The numbers are staggering.
It is difficult to assess the impact of Spanish flu on markets. World War I was raging. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell about 30% from its highs while all the problems unfolded.
Health-care technology, of course, has advanced significantly over the past 100 years. And world health officials are working to mitigate disease transmission and impact., including in the U.S. where travelers entering the country are widely being screened.",business

755,Coronavirus: second confirmed US case identified in Chicago,"A Chicago woman who returned from a trip to China has been identified as the US’ s second confirmed case of the coronavirus. The Illinois department of health has confirmed the latest diagnosis to local news radio station WBBM.
According to health officials, the 60-year-old displayed symptoms shortly after returning to the US. After calling her doctor, the woman was quickly treated in a local hospital. She later tested positive for the virus.
Chicago health officials confirm the woman travelled from the Wuhan region of China, believed to be the virus’ s epicenter. Chinese authorities have since barred people from entering and leaving the quarantined Wuhan area.
The coronavirus has killed nearly 30 people, affecting more than 800 across five countries including Japan, Thailand and South Korea. Most were 60 or older. Some also had a previous medical condition or flu-like symptoms.
The US is the fifth country to report a case of the illness and began screening air passengers at airports nationwide.
The woman did not have contact with anyone outside of her home, and had limited exposure to the general public. She also did not use Chicago’ s public transportation system, American’ s third largest.
No instance of human-to-human transmission has been reported in the US, and Dr Allison Arwady, commissioner of the Chicago department of public health, insisted that the woman’ s diagnosis is an isolated case that is “ not a local emergency. ”
Arwady said: “ We obviously take emerging viruses very seriously and there are still many unanswered questions about this novel virus, but I can reassure you that even with this Chicago case, the health risk to the general public from novel coronavirus remains low at this time. ”
She added: “ Chicago has been building its public health preparedness systems for years and we have a solid response plan in place. There is no need for the general public to change their behavior in any way based on this news. ”
Arwady said the woman is “ clinically doing well and in stable condition ”.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC) began distributing educational pamphlets to passengers flying to and from China at Chicago’ s O’ Hare international airport this week.
The airport instituted mandatory screenings of travelers beginning Wednesday, becoming fully operational on Friday.
The CDC announced the first known case of the new coronavirus strain at a press conference earlier this week. A US citizen, also traveling from central China had been diagnosed in Seattle is in currently receiving treatment.
“ The risk to the US public remains low but more cases will likely be confirmed in the coming days, ” said Nancy Messonnier, the director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the CDC.
Health officials in China first began reporting new cases of a viral pneumonia. Hospitals in central China began reporting patients with symptoms such as fever, cough and difficulty breathing. Officials eventually connected the confirmed cases to a food market in Wuhan.
Although the virus most likely originated from animal-to-people contact, Chinese officials this week confirmed their first case of person-to-person contraction.
Still, the World Health Organization is yet to categorize the coronavirus outbreak as a global health crisis, insisting there is no evidence of human-to-human infection outside China.
The US state department issued its most severe travel advisory – level 4: do not travel – for the central Chinese province of Hubei, home to Wuhan, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak.
The Illinois and Chicago public health departments announced they are currently investigating specific locations locally where the woman went after returning to the US.",general
277,Djotodia Returns to the Central African Republic,"Help us continue to fight human rights abuses. Please give now to support our work
Former President’ s Time Marked by Anarchy, Misrule, and Abuse
LewisMudge

Two former leaders accused of serious abuse have recently returned to Central Africa Republic.
Only two weeks after the return of former Central African Republic president Francois Bozizé to the country, former rebel, turned self-appointed president, Michel Djotodia landed in the capital, Bangui, last Friday.
Under Djotodia’ s leadership, the Seleka, a mostly Muslim rebel coalition from the country’ s north, ousted Bozizé in 2013. The Seleka then launched a looting and killing spree in the capital, specifically targeting areas where people close to Bozizé’ s government lived.
We documented how, during the weekend of April 13, 2013, Seleka forces’ pickup trucks entered the Boy-Rabe neighborhood and shot indiscriminately at civilians to make them flee before Seleka men looted their homes. Scores were killed trying to run or plead with the Seleka.
Outside Bangui the situation was worse. Djotodia’ s fighters killed civilians as they fled their homes, destroyed villages, looted schools and medical centers, and stole grain stocks. People fled to the bush where they suffered from disease, hunger, and exposure. That year, we drove through burned out villages and towns, only to be met along the road by starving civilians, living and dying in the bush.
When we shared evidence of crimes committed by the Seleka with Djotodia and his top commanders, we were met with a collective shrug. The consequences of their actions on civilians appeared to be of no concern. During Djotodia’ s brief time as president, the country descended into a chaos that continues to have ramifications today. When he fled in 2014, he left behind a country in ruins.
Djotodia is reported to have stayed in close contact with some Seleka factions. His return, along with Bozizé’ s, shows that those responsible for serious crimes feel, for now, untouchable. But their presence could give the government and its partners an opportunity to break with the past. A Special Criminal Court, established in June 2015, has a mandate to cover crimes committed by the Seleka. Additionally, an International Criminal Court investigation is ongoing. Prosecuting alleged crimes by the Seleka, and holding leaders like Djotodia accountable, could end the impunity that has driven so much violence and death over the past seven years.

610,Wuhan coronavirus outbreak comes at a terrible time: Chinese New Year — Quartz,"The outbreak of a mysterious virus in China has infected hundreds and killed nine. The exact source has yet to be determined, human-to-human transmission has been confirmed, and Chinese health authorities say the virus has mutated and will likely spread further.
Now add to that China’ s busiest travel season, as hundreds of millions are expected to criss-cross the country to get home for Lunar New Year family reunions kicking off this week—New Year’ s Eve falls on Friday, Jan. 24—and millions more making trips abroad. Nearly 120 million railway trips have already been made from Jan. 10 to 19, according to the transport ministry, a 20% increase compared to last year. But such a large-scale migration of people at a time of a virus outbreak will likely spread the disease further, both within China and beyond. Cases have already shown up in Thailand, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and the United States.
“ Four hundred million people going home for Chinese New Year is certainly going to potentially complicate the control of this outbreak, ” said Allen Cheng, a professor of infectious diseases epidemiology at Monash University in Australia. And though train stations and airports have set up mechanisms like temperature checks, he added, “ evidence suggest that entry screening isn’ t very effective at identifying people with new viruses. ”
Around the world, airports have stepped up screening measures. But the fact that the symptoms of the new coronavirus seem to be relatively mild—fever, cough, tightness of the chest, and difficulty with breathing—is “ paradoxically more worrying ” because it allows people to travel further before their symptoms are detected, Antoine Flahault, director of the Institute of Global Health at the University of Geneva, told Agence France-Presse. China’ s health commission at a press conference on Wednesday warned that the virus is still evolving.
The new virus belongs to the same family as the SARS virus that hit mainland China and Hong Kong hard in 2003, leading to nearly 800 deaths, but scientists who have sequenced the current strain say it is quite distant from that virus.
Chinese health officials have urged people to limit travel, though they have stopped short of enforcing actual blanket travel bans. They have also asked people to limit public gatherings. In Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province and the epicenter of the outbreak, officials have prohibited outbound tour groups from departing the city, and private cars coming in and out of the city are to be checked for wildlife and live poultry, according to state news outlet People’ s Daily.
Some people have cancelled their Lunar New Year family reunions altogether. “ I made the decision after seeing the spike in the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Wuhan over the weekend, ” said Carol Huang, a Hong Kong-based financial reporter from Wuhan. “ My mother called me three times asking me to cancel the flight, and all of my family’ s spring festival gatherings have been cancelled. ”
Travel and hotel stocks have plummeted in reaction to the news. Hong Kong-listed Air China has slumped almost 7.5% since Monday, while New York-listed Chinese travel services company Trip.com dove almost 8%. Huazhu, the New York-listed Chinese hotel management company, sank more than 10%.
The outbreak at peak season for the travel, retail, and catering industries could deal another blow to an economy already contending with slowing economic growth, and food price inflation due to the spread of African swine fever among pigs last year. Lunar New Year holiday spending, which has seen its growth tapering, nevertheless hit $ 150 billion in 2019 for the seven-day period people typically take off.",tech
882,What's changed between the 2003 SARS outbreak and the current Wuhan coronavirus,"In the Chinese city of Wuhan, some 1,000 kilometers ( 620 miles) from the origin of the outbreak, Li -- then a 15-year-old high school student -- was cramming for exams.
Classes were running, but students were told they couldn't go home between their afternoon and evening classes, so parents clustered outside the school gate to pass boxes of food to their children.
Li, not his real name, said his school smelled of vinegar, due to a belief that vinegar fumes would help prevent the spread of disease.
CNN agreed to Li's request not to publish his name -- he's now an academic and fears any perceived criticism of the government could damage his career.
For Li, SARS didn't feel like something he was going to catch himself.

Back then, there were no high-speed trains linking Wuhan with other cities, and the southern province of Guangdong, where the outbreak started, felt very far away. Some people wore masks, others didn't.
Almost two decades later, Asia is on the brink of another pandemic, say experts. For many, it feels eerily similar to the SARS outbreak that infected over 8,000 people and killed 774 around the world between November 2002 and July 2003. SARS is also a type of coronavirus, which causes flu-like symptoms, and can mutate as it spreads from person to person.
In the past month, at least 41 people have died and more than a thousand people have been diagnosed as infected by the Wuhan coronavirus, a cousin of SARS. Cases have been reported in a number of countries, including the United States, France, and Singapore.
Transport is on lockdown in Wuhan -- a city of 11 million and the epicenter of the virus -- and in 10 nearby cities. This is all happening at the worst possible time of year: Lunar New Year, the most significant holiday in the Chinese calendar, when three billion trips were expected to be made.

Even before Wuhan closed train stations and airports, Li -- who is now 31 and working in Macao -- decided, for the first time in his adult life, not to go home for Lunar New Year, which is also known in the mainland as Spring Festival. He worries for his family's health, but says there's little he personally can do.
`` I would hope the government learned a lesson from what happened 17 years ago, '' said Li. `` It seems like they are taking the issue seriously, but I am not sure if it is a little bit too late. ''
Six weeks into the outbreak, there are signs that China is handling this outbreak differently. But there's still concern over China's response -- and just how transparent Beijing is being.

What went wrong during SARS
In the first few months of the 2003 SARS outbreak, China kept the disease under wraps.
SARS was first publicly reported in February 2003, but by that time the country was already months into an outbreak. Five people had died and another 300 had fallen ill from the disease in Guangdong province.
In April 2003, a prominent doctor in Beijing went on the record to accuse the government of a cover-up. Later that month, China sacked its health minister and the mayor of Beijing over their mishandling of the outbreak.
And it wasn't until April -- around five months after the outbreak started -- that American and Canadian scientists announced they had sequenced the genome thought to be the cause of the SARS virus.

The lack of transparency from China, combined with a lack of knowledge about what the virus was and a lack of preparedness among countries in the region in dealing with pandemics, all contributed to SARS's deadly impact.
In semi-autonomous Hong Kong, over 280 people died from SARS -- the highest proportion of death per capita of any territory in the world.
`` The outbreak was very, very difficult to control. At that time, we had no idea what caused the pandemic, '' said Ivan Hung, a specialist in infectious disease at Hong Kong University. `` We were not able to get on top of things and able to make early diagnosis and isolation as a result. There was a lot of cross infection that happened in the hospital. ''

SARS also exposed how ill-prepared China and other territories were at responding to pandemics. In a paper published soon after the epidemic was contained, Hong Kong's former Director of Health Lee Shiu-hung pointed to a number of issues facing the city, including a lack of protective clothing for medical staff, ill-prepared hospital authorities, and basic failings in the healthcare system, like overcrowded wards and poor ventilation.
As Hung puts it, last time around, public health authorities were `` playing catch up. ''
Grace -- a 37-year-old Hong Konger -- was interning at a hotel at the time, and remembers the fear. At her hotel, everyone wore a mask, and people cleaned their hands and phones before starting work.
`` Everyone was worried because nobody knew how serious it was. Everybody had to wear masks wherever they go. Business was not good as well, '' said Grace, who asked CNN not to use her last name out of concern for the impact of her current job. `` People preferred to stay at home if they didn't have to go to work or school. ''
A different China
In the six weeks since the first case of Wuhan coronavirus was detected, it's already clear that today's China isn't the same as the China of 2003.
China informed the World Health Organization about the new virus on December 31, 2019, less than three weeks after the first case was detected on December 12. The virus behind the outbreak was identified on January 7 -- as swift as any other developed country would have been able to identify it, said Ian Lipkin, a professor of epidemiology at Columbia University who worked to contain SARS back in 2003.

The prompt identification of the new strain allowed other countries to develop tests for the virus early on that should help contain the outbreak, said Peter Daszak, the president of non-profit EcoHealth Alliance, which researches emerging infectious diseases.
Experts have also praised China for being transparent about the outbreak -- something the country was criticized for last time. Many are also impressed with China's unprecedented decision this week to stop transport to and from Wuhan during the country's biggest holiday. `` SARS was a huge embarrassment to China, and that's been driving a lot of the openness and transparency around this outbreak, '' Daszak said.
There are other things, too, that should make this outbreak easier to contain than SARS 17 years ago.
China and other Asian countries have stepped up their ability to respond to pandemics. Chinese residents are also more aware of how to protect themselves from the spread of disease, Lipkin said. Face masks are now mandatory in Wuhan, but before that, online sales surged, China Daily reported.

That's also true in Hong Kong. For almost eight months, face masks have been closely associated with the ongoing pro-democracy protest movement. But over the past few weeks, more and more people have been wearing surgical masks in public -- for health reasons. For many, SARS taught them how to respond to the risk of disease.
Surgical masks are now ubiquitous on the subway, and Hong Kong is facing a serious shortage of face masks, according to Horace Lau, the vice president of Hong Kong's General Chamber of Pharmacy.
Grace said she started wearing a mask weeks ago.
`` Since SARS took place in 2003, people in Hong Kong are more conscious about health and how to protect themselves, '' she said.
What hasn't changed
But while China has undoubtedly been more communicative about the Wuhan coronavirus, there's still lingering distrust.
In 2003, then 15-year-old Li didn't think to question the authorities. Now, as an academic living outside mainland China's censorship, Li believes the Chinese government doesn't trust its people to handle the full truth.
`` ( It's this) sort of idea of 'we have to control the scale of the panic instead of the scale of disease, '' he said. `` I can only hope that... they can act better and they can respond quickly instead of keeping people in the dark. ''
On Wednesday, a senior US State Department official said the US was concerned about the Chinese government's transparency.

`` I do believe that the concern you see both inside China and internationally is a reflection of what we 've seen in the past, '' the official said. `` That reluctance to respond in a rapid manner doesn't give the global community a secure feeling for this being managed inside China. ''
However, on Friday President Donald Trump said on Twitter that China `` had been working very hard to contain the Coronavirus '' and thanked Chinese President Xi Jinping.
`` The United States greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency. It will all work out well. In particular, on behalf of the American People, I want to thank President Xi! '' Trump tweeted.
Last weekend, Imperial College London found that an estimated 1,723 people were likely to have been infected by the virus by January 12, significantly more than the 45 confirmed cases around the time the study was released. On Monday, Chinese authorities reported that the number of cases had tripled over the weekend to 218.
Those figures worried some people, but Daszak points out that there are always going to be more people infected than we know about -- not everyone's symptoms are serious enough for them to seek medical attention. Lipkin agrees, saying that authorities are likely being cautious about reporting numbers as it is winter -- a season when people often get flu and pneumonia anyway.

Online, numerous people claim to have been turned away from Wuhan's hospitals. Although CNN has not been able to verify individual claims, Wuhan's health authority acknowledged in a statement that local hospitals were overwhelmed. Officials said the situation would improve as more medical facilities were set aside for the detection and treatment of the virus. According to state media reports, Wuhan plans to build a new hospital in six days.
There's also more to be done to address a major issue: live animal markets.
The coronavirus that caused SARS was traced to the civet cat, a wild animal considered a delicacy in parts of south China. After the outbreak in 2003, China banned the slaughter and consumption of civet cats.
This time around, it's believed the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak started in the now-shuttered Wuhan Huanan Wholesale Seafood Market, where a number of wild animals were for sale, including raccoon dogs and snakes. Experts believe that the coronavirus was carried by animals -- possibly snakes -- and then spread to humans.

Although China bans the trafficking of some wild animals, it is still widely seen as the world's largest market for illicit wildlife products. Experts say markets that sell wild animals need to be banned.
`` It places the whole world at risk. And I don't think we can allow these to continue. The risk is just too great, '' Lipkin said.
Daszak added that countries need to take more preventative measures to stop pandemics.
`` We should treat pandemics a bit like smoking or heart disease, '' he said. `` We spend billions of dollars once they emerge to control an outbreak, but we should also start spending money before they emerge to stop them spilling over to people. ''
Is this SARS all over again?
There's reason to think that the current coronavirus outbreak won't have the same impact as SARS did in 2003.
For now, the virus doesn't seem as deadly. As of Thursday, Daszak estimated that it had a 3.5% mortality rate -- the WHO estimates that SARS had a fatality ratio of 14% to 15%.
This time around, we know what the disease is, and there are potential vaccines that can be trialed, Daszak said. Health authorities are also better prepared, says Hung, who doesn't think that this outbreak will be as bad as SARS.
But authorities also face new difficulties. This outbreak coincides with the Lunar New Year, and in the past 17 years, China has seen a dramatic increase in international and domestic travel.

China's expansive trade network means the virus could spread to places like Africa, where testing might not be so intensive, Daszak said. Even in more developed countries, identifying people who were potentially infected still largely depends on them self-reporting their symptoms -- something some people just won't do.
At the moment, the disease hasn't become a super-spreader like SARS. If a disease is a super-spreader, it means that one person infects many people. There has been one report of a single patient infecting 14 health care workers, but no other similar cases have been reported.
But if the virus evolves to become a super-spreader, Daszak said that would `` basically be a repeat of SARS. ''
`` It's beginning to look more and more like SARS every day, '' Daszak said, adding that the decision to shut down Wuhan suggested the authorities know something about the way the disease spreads that isn't good news.
Whether this epidemic turns into SARS or not depends on how the disease evolves -- and how well public health authorities manage to contain it, he said.
`` Right now, we are on the cusp of what could be a repeat of the SARS pandemic. ''",business
763,Asian stocks quiet on Lunar New Year's eve after a turbulent week -- Asian market latest,"Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index ( HSI), closed up nearly 0.2% Friday during a shortened trading session. Japan's Nikkei 225 ( N225) closed up 0.1%.
Chinese markets were closed, and won't reopen until late next week.
The relative calm came a day after China's Shanghai Composite ( SHCOMP) posted its worst single-day percentage drop in more than eight months as the deadly coronavirus spread across the country, causing officials to place Wuhan, the central Chinese city where it originated, and two of its neighboring cities, under a partial lockdown.
The sell-off Thursday was `` the most significant pre- [ Lunar New Year ] stock market rout on record, '' said Stephen Innes, chief market strategist at AxiTrader, in a note to clients this week.
The shortened trading week was the Shanghai Composite's worst since early August, when China allowed for a surprise devaluation of its currency, stoking fears about the US-China trade war.
The Hang Seng, meanwhile, lost 3.8% this week, its worst since mid-November when the city was rattled by violent, escalating protests.
China's coronavirus problem is getting worse. As of Friday, the death toll from the disease had jumped to at least 26. More than 800 people have been infected, mostly in mainland China, though the disease has spread as far as the United States.
The World Health Organization said Thursday that it would not yet declare a global public health emergency over the virus.
That helped soothe traders ' jitters and provided markets with a sense of calm, Innes wrote Friday.
Still, investors are nervous that the crisis could stick around for a while.
`` There are rising concerns that the economic impact could extend beyond the '' Lunar New Year, analysts at Jefferies, wrote in a note Thursday.
Companies with headquarters or significant business in Wuhan and the surrounding area `` may suffer the most, '' they added.
According to Jefferies research, Chinese companies that are most exposed to fallout from the spread of the virus include Dongfeng Motor ( DNFGY), a large Chinese auto group based in Wuhan. The company's Hong Kong-listed shares fell 1.2% Friday.

373,Coronavirus: China reports 17 new cases of Sars-like mystery virus,"Chinese authorities are to step up efforts to contain the outbreak of a new virus before the lunar new year holidays amid fears of the bug spreading to other countries.
Health officials in Wuhan, the city at the heart of the outbreak, confirmed 17 new cases of the Sars-like coronavirus on Sunday, including three patients who are said to be in a severe condition.
The new strain has caused alarm because of its connection to severe acute respiratory syndrome, which killed more than 750 people globally in 2002-03.
Adding to those concerns is the imminent movement of hundreds of millions of Chinese who will be travelling to visit family during the holidays that start next week, increasing the potential for the virus to spread further afield.
“ Our commission will step up our guard during the spring festival, pay close attention to the development and change of the epidemic, and direct the implementation of prevention and control measures, ” China’ s national health commission said on Sunday, adding that it believed the outbreak could be controlled.
Of the 17 new cases confirmed in Wuhan, three were described as severe and two patients were too critical to be moved, authorities said.
Two people have died from the virus in Wuhan, the largest city in central China. Three cases have been confirmed abroad – two in Thailand and one in Japan, involving people either from Wuhan or who had recently visited the city.
The virus has infected 62 people in Wuhan, with eight in a severe condition, 19 cured and discharged from hospital, and the rest remaining in isolation where they are receiving treatment. Those infected have ranged from 30 to 79 years old.
Authorities said they had begun “ optimised ” testing of pneumonia cases across the city to identify others infected, and would begin “ detection work … towards suspected cases in the city ” as a next step, as well as carrying out “ sampling tests ”.
The World Health Organization said on Sunday that some of the new cases did not appear to be linked to the Huanan seafood market, the suspected source of the outbreak.
“ The fact that three cases have been exported to Thailand and Japan without connection to the Huanan seafood market suggests that the virus has spread beyond the Huanan seafood market into the community, ” David Hui, a professor of respiratory medicine at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, told Reuters.
Wuhan’ s deputy mayor, Chen Yanxin, said oversight would be strengthened at big events and the number of public gatherings would be reduced, state media reported. Since 14 January, city officials have used infrared thermometers at airports, railways and other routes into the city to screen passengers, but their task is being hampered by this being the peak of the influenza season.
Chen said passengers with fevers were being registered, given masks and taken to medical institutions, with nearly 300,000 body temperature tests carried out, according to CCTV.
Scientists with the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College in London said in a paper published on Friday that the number of cases in the city was likely to be closer to 1,700 – much higher than the number officially identified.
No human-to-human transmission has been confirmed so far, but Wuhan’ s health commission has previously said the possibility “ can not be excluded ”.
Authorities in Hong Kong have stepped up detection measures, including rigorous temperature checkpoints for inbound travellers from the Chinese mainland.
The US said from Friday it would begin screening direct flights arriving from Wuhan at San Francisco airport and New York’ s JFK as well as Los Angeles, where many flights connect.
Thailand said it was already screening passengers arriving in Bangkok, Chiang Mai and Phuket and would soon introduce similar controls in the beach resort of Krabi.
Wuhan is a major transport hub, including during the lunar new year holiday when Chinese people make an estimated 3bn trips around the country to visit family.",general
41,Cambodia building collapse death toll hits 36 as rescue called off,"Hi, what are you looking for?
By
Published
The search for victims in the rubble of a collapsed building in southern Cambodia drew to a close Sunday with the final death toll at 36 -- the latest tragedy in a string of deadly construction accidents.
Cambodia Prime Minister Hun Sen, said 23 people had been pulled alive from the rubble of the seven-storey hotel, which crumpled to the ground in seaside Kep on Friday afternoon.
On Sunday rescuers also managed to free a dog trapped in the debris.
`` This is yet another tragedy, '' said Hun Sen, who promised families of victims would get $ 50,000 each in compensation, while those injured would receive $ 20,000, he said.
He told reporters the contractor responsible for the construction had died in the accident, while the building's owner had been detained.
The rescue effort lasted more 40 hours, mobilizing hundreds of soldiers and labourers using excavators, drills and power saws to clear concrete and cut through metal bars of the pancaked structure.
Cambodia is undergoing a construction boom, with hotels, high-rises and casinos springing up under little regulatory oversight.
The tough and often dangerous labour is undertaken by an estimated 200,000 construction workers, mostly unskilled, reliant on day wages and not protected by union rules, according to the International Labour Organisation.
Last June some 28 people died in the collapse of a building under construction in Sihanoukville, a beach town flush with Chinese investment that.
Worker advocacy groups point to low safety standards that raise the risk of accidents at construction sites -- which often serve as the temporary homes for the labourers and their families.
Worker Ei Kosal told AFP on Saturday that he, his wife and two other women were having a meal on site when the building collapsed.
Their two companions were crushed.
`` I did not expect to survive... it's like I have just been reborn, '' Kosal from hospital.

143,Walgreens’ shares tumble by 5% on earnings posting,"Hi, what are you looking for?
By
Published
After hitting rock bottom in 2019 and landing the title of worst performer in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, many industry commentators are beginning to question Walgreens ability to prosper in the new decade. Walgreens has faced intense competition from the arrival of Amazon.com Inc in the pharmacy market in the past year. Walgreens has also seen its gross margins come under pressure of late, with generic drug cost inflation being a key factor.
As reported on Investor Business Daily, Dow Jones stock Walgreens Boots Alliance reported fiscal first-quarter earnings that fell more than expected. According to Forbes, the global pharmacy chain may be taken into private ownership in a massive leveraged buyout
Despite these various challenges, Walgreens’ may be able to pull ahead as long as it can deliver on its new frictionless shopping strategy. Such a strategy involves identifying and removing any hassles and pain points that arise when customers interact with the organization
Walgreens’ recent pivot away from a brick-and-mortar based strategy toward a frictionless CX strategy — including innovations like the use of drones for delivery — is a step in the right direction to regaining its position as a leader in the industry, according to Kate Hogenson, a loyalty and CX expert at Kobie, in a message sent to Digital Journal.
With the drone technology, Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. provided information about their last-mile delivery innovations, at CES 2020, as e-commerce continues to upend traditional retail and logistics business models.

633,Procter & Gamble ( PG) earnings Q2 2020,"Procter & Gamble on Thursday reported quarterly revenue that fell short of estimates for the first time in five quarters, hurt by a stronger dollar and a struggling baby segment, which includes Pampers diapers.
But the consumer giant also raised its 2020 forecast and beat Wall Street's earnings estimates.
`` We continue to face the challenges of a very volatile macro and geopolitical landscape and a competitive response to our growth, but all-in, we're continuing to make progress behind a set of integrated and mutually reinforcing strategies, '' Chief Financial and Operating Officer Jon Moeller told analysts.
Shares were trading up less than 1% in morning trading after initially falling as much as 2% before the market opened.
Here's what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by Refinitiv:
P & G reported fiscal second-quarter net income of $ 3.72 billion, or $ 1.41 per share, up from $ 3.19 billion, or $ 1.22 per share, a year earlier.
Excluding items, the consumer giant earned $ 1.42 per share, topping the $ 1.37 per share expected by analysts surveyed by Refinitiv.
Net sales rose 5% to $ 18.24 billion, falling short of expectations of $ 18.37 billion. Stripping out the impacts of foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestitures, organic sales increased 5%, helped by strong growth in its health care and beauty units.
Its health care business, which includes brands like Vicks and Oral B, saw organic sales growth of 7%, and its beauty business reported 8% organic sales growth, driven by double-digit growth in skin and personal care products, which include SK-II and Olay. P & G's fabric and home care business, which includes brands like Tide and Ariel, saw organic sales increase by 5% during the quarter.
Organic sales of P & G's baby care segment declined by low-single digits. The company attributed the decrease to competition, fewer customers buying baby products in certain markets and an inventory decrease in Japan, its third-largest market, due to an increase in the country's value-added tax.
Moeller told analysts that the decrease in Chinese birth rates has hit the overall baby care category. Rival Kimberly-Clark, which owns Huggies diapers, said Thursday that its overall volumes for baby and child care declined by mid-single digits during its fiscal fourth quarter.
China and the United States are P & G's two largest markets. Moeller said that the company will be monitoring the coronavirus spreading in China because it can also effect consumer confidence and travel.
`` I have no idea what the investments are going to be relative to the new virus, '' he said on the conference call.
Organic sales of P & G's shaving segment, which includes Gillette and Venus, rebounded to low-single digit growth during the quarter, thanks to new products like the Gillette SkinGuard and price increases driven by currency changes that make imports more expensive.
In early January, the company announced plans to acquire Billie, a direct-to-consumer shaving company aimed at women.
`` Clearly, they 've created very effectively a fresh, new brand that extends across several categories, and they 've done it, and we can benefit from their experience on this in a digital fashion with one-to-one mass marketing, '' Moeller said.
P & G has been trying to reignite sales for its Gillette and Venus products as Billie, Unilever's Dollar Shave Club and Edgewell Personal Care's Harry's lure away its customers.
P & G now expects sales growth of 4% to 5% in fiscal 2020, up from its prior range of 3% to 5%. It also expects core earnings per share to increase to a range of 8% to 11%, up from its prior range of 5% to 10%.
The company expects to buy back more shares during fiscal 2020. It raised its repurchase range to $ 7 billion to $ 8 billion, up from $ 6 billion to $ 8 billion. During its second quarter, P & G bought back $ 3.5 billion of common stock.
Shares of P & G, which has a market value of $ 309 billion, have risen nearly 31% over the last year.
The stock of rival Kimberly-Clark, valued at $ 49.5 billion, is up 28% in the same time period. Shares of the Kleenex owner were unchanged in premarket trading after it topped analyst estimates for its quarterly earnings and revenue and raised its quarterly dividend from $ 1.03 to $ 1.07.

152,Philippine Catholics swarm Christ icon hoping for miracle,"Hi, what are you looking for?
By
Published
Swarms of barefoot believers thronged a revered icon of Jesus Christ on Thursday in Manila for a lumbering and raucous procession considered one of the world's largest shows of Catholic fervour.
As the tropical sun beat down on the capital, hundreds of thousands of faithful were packed along the route for the procession of the so-called Black Nazarene, which they believe grants miracles.
Devotees clad in maroon and yellow risked injury clambering over one another to touch the life-size statue, wipe a white towel on it or lay a hand on the fat ropes used to pull its metal float.
`` We believe that if you pull the carriage, the Lord will cure all your diseases, '' 50-year-old vendor Boyet Lara told AFP. `` Nothing is impossible if we believe. ''
Local officials ' estimate put the number of participants at roughly two million, though AFP could not verify that figure.
The crush of humanity causes scores of injuries every year, and as the procession neared its final stretch authorities reported some 200 among the barefoot faithful had suffered sprains, scrapes or heat exhaustion.
`` In 2016, the rope pulling the statue wrapped around my head and I nearly choked to death. But I managed to survive, '' said devotee Crisostomo Belarmino, 52.
`` I cried that time and said 'Thank you Nazarene for giving me another life, ' '' he added.
There were no immediate reports of deaths, which have periodically plagued the event in prior years, often due to heat or pre-existing health problems.
The statue is named for its charred appearance and is accompanied by many difficult to prove stories, including that it survived a fire while en route to the Philippines in the 17th century.
Critics call the procession a mish-mash of superstition and unnecessary risk for the people who leave home barefoot and cram into the procession route each year.
However, officials in the Philippines ' powerful Catholic Church called it a demonstration of participants ' `` overflowing faith, an expression of their devotion ''.
Many devotees swear the Black Nazarene has brought them help when they needed it most.
`` When my husband suffered a stroke two years ago, even if I didn't ask for financial help, I got it, '' vendor Angeline Mara, 43, said.
`` Every time I hear the song for the Nazarene, I feel like I 'm about to cry, '' she added.
Though authorities did not report any specific threat to this year's procession, there was a typically massive presence of thousands of police on Manila's streets.
The Philippines is plagued by violent insurgencies, including Islamic State-linked militants that have carried out bombings on civilian targets.

328,Emerging Strategies in the Evolving Area of Predictive Scheduling,"States and cities nationwide have instituted predictive scheduling laws, aiming to give employees a greater sense of certainty around their work schedule. However, with laws varying by jurisdiction, employers don’ t enjoy the same level of certainty. Fisher Phillips’ Collin Cook and Anthony Guzman shed some light.
For decades, the problem of scheduling has plagued employers and employees alike. Employees prefer predictable and reliable schedules. Employers, however, need flexibility.
To address this tension, regulators throughout the United States have recently begun to insert themselves into the struggle through the passage of predictive scheduling laws that seek to strike a tenuous balance between these competing interests. Given the recent rise in the popularity of these laws, it is important for organizations to understand what these laws are, where they are most likely to be encountered and what steps they can take to make stay abreast of the most up-to-date compliance strategies.
Predictive scheduling laws are straightforward. In short, they require employers to post employee work schedules a certain number of days in advance of when the work is to be performed. Once posted, however, employers can be penalized for making any subsequent scheduling changes.
In theory, these laws seek to balance respective interests between employers and employees — a balance that was recently addressed in the landmark California decision, Ward v. Tilly’ s. Therein, the court assumed the role of the employee’ s champion and explained that, from the employee’ s perspective, schedule predictability was an absolute necessity that allowed employees to, among other things, plan around second jobs, make child-care arrangements, coordinate school schedules and commit to social plans. Glaringly absent from this analysis, however, was the employer’ s perspective and concurrent recognition that scheduling changes and fluctuating staffing needs are often caused by unforeseeable market realities, such inclement weather, employee call outs and unposted community events.
In practice, unfortunately, legislators have expressed wide disagreement over how to address this problem, causing many jurisdictions to take wildly different approaches. For example, in New York City, certain employers are only required to post schedules 72 hours in advance, with changes thereafter being completely prohibited. In contrast, San Francisco requires employers to post schedules not less than two weeks in advance. Once posted, however, any changes require the employer to pay the affected employee anywhere between one and four hours of additional “ predictability pay, ” depending on how last minute the change actually was. As these examples demonstrate, the lack of a centralized model for predictive scheduling laws has created a potential minefield for employers who attempt to apply consistent scheduling practices in multiple jurisdictions.
Since the first predictive scheduling law arose in San Francisco in 2016, other states and major U.S. cities have contributed to a precipitous rise in these laws. Places like Vermont, Oregon, New York City, Chicago, Seattle and Philadelphia have all proposed and implemented their own unique frameworks. Simultaneously, other states have actively sought to combat the rise of these practices. In the wake of San Francisco’ s law, states like Arkansas, Iowa, Georgia and Tennessee quickly implemented legislation that prohibited their own major cities from enacting similar predictive scheduling laws, seeking to stifle an already emerging trend.
To date, however, the retail and hospitality industries have taken the brunt of the regulatory force, with the vast majority of predictive scheduling laws targeting these industries exclusively. As justification for this disparate treatment, legislators have pointed to the disproportionate number of low-wage workers present in these industries who, by their nature, warrant greater protection. For these employees, securing a reliable schedule through traditional means, such as direct negotiation, is far less likely. Accordingly, in these industries, employer/employee tension between scheduling flexibility and predictably is at its zenith.
Unsurprisingly, established players in these industries have already begun to feel the impact of these new scheduling strictures. For example, in September 2019, the New York City Department of Consumer and Worker Protection filed a substantial lawsuit against certain private businesses for various compliance failures, such as:
As a result, the lawsuit alleges nearly $ 1 million in prospective liability amidst a combination of employee restitution and state penalties — a figure that’ s certainly nothing to balk at.
Unfortunately, compliance with predictive scheduling laws is far from easy.
Although larger employers with locations throughout multiple jurisdictions tend to be the most affected, smaller employers can also find themselves in a position that requires a full overhaul of their current staffing model. Accordingly, it’ s important to keep a few points in mind:
In the modern day, employment laws are changing at an ever-increasing pace. Additionally, when it comes to employment policies, there is rarely a one-size-fits-all approach, and what’ s right for one company may not be right for another. As a result, it is important to keep up to date on the newest changes in both law and compliance strategies.

897,Dow Jones Industrial Average Suffers Largest Weekly Drop Since August,"It’ s taken Selena Gomez many years and three consecutive No. 1 albums—her most recent, Rare, was released earlier this month—to shake the perception of her as a troubled child star. Perceptions of the stock market, unfortunately, can shift in a matter of days.
In our previous column, as the major indexes started the year off with a bang, we mused about the possibility of the Dow Jones Industrial Average hitting 30,000. The spread of coronavirus—a respiratory virus most of us weren’ t familiar with until this past week—in China and abroad put that celebration on hold. The Dow dropped 358.37 points, or 1.2%, to 28,989.73, while the S & P 500 index fell 1%, to 3295.47, and the Nasdaq Composite declined 0.8%, to 9314.91. It was the biggest one-week drop for the S & P and the Dow since August.
With the arrival of coronavirus on the scene, information that might have been relevant no longer is. We were looking forward to the release of December’ s durable-goods orders, housing data, and consumer-confidence numbers, as well as fourth-quarter gross-domestic-product data this coming week. Now, those numbers are mostly meaningless. Look no further than the yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which fell to 1.68% this past week, its lowest level since October.
“ Alas, if the recent range-challenging price action is any indication, the forward looking prospects will be much more reliant on coronavirus than anything revealed about the final quarter of 2019, ” writes BMO Capital Markets’ Ian Lyngen.
That is a big change from the week before, when low yields were a sign that inflation was low and the Federal Reserve was on hold. Now, they’ re a reason to be worried about the strength of the U.S. economy. Yet Leuthold Group strategist James Paulsen notes that low bond yields often have been good for the stock market.
When the yield on the 10-year is over 3%, an all-stock portfolio has outperformed an all-bond portfolio by 2.3 percentage points annually. When the 10-year is below 3%, stocks offer more than six times the return. “ Rather than raise anxieties, perhaps equity investors should simply embrace amazingly low yields, which historically have made ‘ risk less risky,’ ” Paulsen writes.
But that doesn’ t mean the stock market is suddenly risk-free. As we suggested last week, the market was ready for a pullback—and one may finally be on its way. Most metrics suggest the market was overbought following its recent melt-up. The S & P 500, for instance, has gone 71 days without a 1% move in either direction, the longest such streak since Oct. 9, 2018. The Nasdaq, meanwhile, has closed at a record high 28 times since the beginning of November, the most in a three-month stretch since February 2000—you know, right before the dot-com bubble popped.
But this isn’ t the dot-com bubble, and the coronavirus is unlikely to be the thing that tips the U.S. into recession. Market internals are still strong, with the advance/decline line, a cumulative measure of the number of stocks rising versus those falling, still making new highs ( it usually diverges four months before a market top). This drop is likely not the big one, even if it may feel that way.
“ Even 5% corrections are not fun, ” writes Frank Gretz of Wellington Shields. “ They tell you they’ re ‘ buying opportunities’ and they are. They don’ t tell you that down 5% the news turns bad and then you’ re afraid the 5% turns to 10% or 15%. ”
So far, it’ s hardly a 5% drop. But brace yourselves, just in case.",business

Gucci, Adidas and Uniqlo are all playing it safe this Chinese New Year. Will their cutesy collaborations pay off during one of the biggest moments in the global shopping calendar?
SHANGHAI, China – Mickey Mouse has overtaken China. A quick stroll down Nanjing Xi Lu, one of Shanghai’ s most popular shopping streets, takes shoppers past Uniqlo, Gap and Gucci – all of which are stocking Mickey-related products. The 91-year-old cartoon character’ s friendly visage stares out from almost every other shop window.China’ s 1.4 billion people are gearing up for the biggest holiday of the year, with an official week-long holiday beginning January 24, the eve of the Lunar New Year. Despite concerns about the deadly coronavirus that has spread from Wuhan to other major Chinese cities, people will travel in their hundreds of millions to celebrate with family as the calendar ticks over to the “ Year of the Rat ” on January 25.The upcoming shunian, or “ Rat Year ” has proven to be something of a boom for The Walt Disney Company, with its endearing rodent mascot representing a safe way for brands of all price-points across the fashion, beauty and accessories sectors to give a nod to the New Year – and to traditional Chinese culture, without being too serious or controversial. “ In China, we have been preparing for the ‘ Year of the Mouse’ for the last three years, ” Kermid Rahman, vice president and general manager for consumer products commercialisation at The Walt Disney Company, Greater China and Korea, explained. Though the Chinese term shunian is generally translated as “ Year of the Rat ”, the word shu actually means rat and mouse interchangeably. Li Ning x Mickey Mouse Campaign 2020 | Source: Courtesy “ Our China-based creative team integrated Chinese elements into Mickey and Minnie product style guides in a locally relevant way. They developed approximately 20,000 SKU localised products for the Chinese Lunar New Year, ” Rahman added.In addition to Uniqlo, Gap and Gucci plugging their Mickey collaborations in the lead-up to Spring Festival, other domestic and international fashion and sportswear brands feature limited edition Chinese New Year products with Disney’ s Mickey and Minnie Mouse characters, including Columbia, Li Ning, Adidas, Urban Revivo, Chocoolate, Vero Moda, Peacebird, Zhang Dayi and Metersbonwe.In the beauty sector, Innisfree, SK-II, Neutrogena, Dr Jart+, Elizabeth Arden and Maybelline also have Mickey-related Chinese New Year products; and Pandora and Chow Tai Fook are releasing Mickey Mouse accessories as part of their holiday offerings. “ In China, we not only work with global high-end brands, but we work with more than 450 local licensee partners… [ to bring ] better products, greater innovation and happiness to more Chinese consumers, ” Rahman added.As an aesthetic proposition, the Year of the Rat presents inherent challenges, as opposed to, for example, the Year of the Dragon or Horse, animals that are more easily rendered in a visually appealing way. This makes Mickey an enticing choice, but perhaps more important than looking good, Mickey is also a safe choice.Throughout their history of doing business in China and interacting with local holidays, Chinese New Year collaborations have notoriously been hit and miss for global brands with numerous missteps being seized upon by Chinese netizens for ridicule. In 2019, Burberry bore the brunt of criticism with its campaign depicting unsmiling, unconventional family portraits that were widely labelled “ creepy ” by Chinese consumers.I think after a number of cultural shocks... all of the international brands are trying to be safer.Criticism of international luxury brands from Chinese consumers was something of a theme throughout 2019, with a crescendo in August that saw brands from Versace, to Givenchy and Coach, lose Chinese celebrity ambassadors who quit in protest following the release of products considered offensive for labelling Taiwan and Hong Kong as countries separate from China.This trend has seemingly made international brands even more gun shy when it comes to Chinese New Year products and campaigns in 2020, according to Jason Yu, the Shanghai-based general manager of market research firm Kantar Worldpanel. “ I think after a number of cultural shocks and very expensive lessons learned last year, all of the international brands are trying to be safer, ” he said.However, not everyone has been won over by the Mickey Mouse collections, particularly at the luxury end of the fashion spectrum. One of WeChat’ s top-ranked fashion accounts, iiiher, penned an article that was particularly critical of Gucci’ s collaboration, ridiculing the cost of 30 to 40 thousand yuan ( $ 4,350 to $ 5,800) products and comparing them to similar products available from fast fashion brands and Taobao stores for a fraction of the price.Gucci’ s collection has received plenty of coverage within China, largely because of its co-operation with high-profile KOLs such as Mr Bags and Fil Xiaobai, who along with celebrity ambassador Ni Ni were filmed enjoying Disneyland with their families wearing the collection, vlogs that were then pushed out on Weibo. Gucci Chinese New Year 2020 campaign | Source: Courtesy Mr Bags, whose real name is Tao Liang, told BoF that Gucci in particular had been paying attention to the growth in influence that KOLs have enjoyed in China over the past year, with as many as 48 percent of online consumers in China buying products directly from links provided by KOLs. “ More attention is paid to the influence of KOLs [ and ] Gucci quickly captured the influence of KOL’ s Weibo [ accounts ] and built a large, breakthrough campaign [ around that ]. It’ s actually very powerful and timely, '' he said.As to whether the “ cuteness ” of a Disney collaboration might diminish the positioning of a luxury brand, Jason Yu says that on the contrary it helps brands connect with younger consumers, a key demographic for international luxury companies.According to a 2019 report from McKinsey, China’ s post-80s consumers ( the first generation in China to grow up with Mickey Mouse, following the reform and opening period of the late-70s) account for more than half of the total luxury spend by Chinese consumers; the post-90s generation, meanwhile, are the fastest growing luxury consumer cohort in China. “ For younger consumers Mickey Mouse is going to be a very popular choice, ” Yu said. “ I would say that all the luxury brands are trying to launch products that are appealing to younger consumers, rather than the classic luxury consumer target. ” Interestingly, these age groups have also been targeted by The Walt Disney Company in China, with a shift from products targeting children to those targeting young adults in recent years. “ Currently, 55 percent of Disney consumer products are purchased by young adults and 45 percent are by children. Ten years ago, the ratio for adults and children was 15 percent and 85 percent respectively, ” Disney’ s Rahman said.There’ s little doubt the safe haven of cuteness and universal appeal of Disney’ s favourite mouse has won Chinese New Year in 2020. Although there’ s not much in the way of innovative campaigns breaking through the noise this season, perhaps brands are happy to just keep their heads down and avoid attracting attention for the wrong reasons.Additional reporting from Jing Wang时尚与美容FASHION & BEAUTYThe exterior of an IT store in Hong Kong | Source: CourtesyHong Kong-based Fashion and Jewellery Brands Lose GroundFashion retailer IT saw same-store sales in Hong Kong and Macau fall 33.3 percent in the third quarter, a drop the brand attributed to recent social unrest in Hong Kong hitting tourism.

( Glossy) How Chinese Fashion Brands Can Achieve Global DominationChina buys, produces and exports most of the world’ s clothing – but somehow, Chinese consumers are still wearing clothes designed in the US, Europe, Japan and even Korea. This begs the question: why are Chinese brands still struggling to find the spotlight? Most Western consumers would be hard pressed to name a Chinese fashion brand. This is partly because China’ s domestic market is so big that many brands are simply not motivated to make a global expansion. Marketing to Western audiences is another challenge which requires brands to help international audience understand the cultural references and craftsmanship behind Chinese design.

192,CES 2020: Porch pirates stopped with IoTLock,"Hi, what are you looking for?
By
Published
Global e-commerce is growing exponentially, with the value expected to hit $ 4.5 trillion in 2021. Millions of packages are delivered each day, and this has led to an increase in package theft by “ porch pirates ” targeting homes without secured delivery boxes. In addition, third-party security systems have shown themselves to be susceptible to hacks and guilty of storing consumers’ personal data.
A new product called IoTLock, from the company It’ s Here Inc., aims to put an end to this by allowing anyone to create their own blockchain-secured keypad devices for the home or office.
A blockchain is an expanding list of digital records, referred to as blocks. These blocks are linked using cryptography. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data ( what’ s called a Merkle tree).
READ MORE: 2020 trends on enterprise automation revealed
IoTLock is a software system and mobile decentralized application that can turn any keypad-enabled device into a blockchain-secured container with just a few pieces of hardware. With this technology, users can manage their locked devices, monitor multiple devices, and share or revoke access — all without third-party providers collecting any data.
The solution works with mailboxes, delivery boxes, and safes, into blockchain-secured smart devices.

779,Shanghai Disney shuts to prevent spread of virus,"Walt Disney's Shanghai Disney Resort will be closed until further notice to help China stop the spread of a flu-like virus, costing the theme park operator revenue during the country's biggest holiday season.
China is on a seven-day Lunar New Year holiday, a period when the Shanghai Disney park would be usually packed with tourists. Last year Shanghai Disney had to stop selling tickets to visitors as the park got overcrowded.
`` In response to the prevention and control of the disease outbreak and in order to ensure the health and safety of our guests and Cast, Shanghai Disney Resort is temporarily closing Shanghai Disneyland, Disneytown... starting Jan. 25, '' the company said on its website.
`` We will continue to carefully monitor the situation and... announce the reopening date upon confirmation. ''
Wuhan, a city of 11 million people, and neighboring Huanggang, a city of about 7 million people, were in virtual lockdown, with restrictions in place elsewhere. A new coronavirus which broke out in Wuhan, central China, late last year has killed 25 people and infected more than 800.
Many businesses including retailers, airlines, travel agencies and hotel operators are on high alert, as health authorities fear the infection rate could accelerate over the Lunar New Year, when hundreds of millions of Chinese travel at home and abroad.
The outbreak has already prompted seven Chinese films that were set to premiere during the holiday to postpone screenings, forgoing what is usually the best week of the year at the Chinese box office.
Disney said it would refund tickets for admission to Shanghai Disneyland, on China's east coast, more than 800 km from Wuhan, or other services at the park as well as hotel bookings.
The estimated financial impact on the U.S. company's first theme park in mainland China, which opened in mid-2016 in its largest overseas investment at $ 5.5 billion, was not immediately clear.
The company was not immediately available to comment.
Shanghai Disney carried out a resort-wide makeover this month for a four-week event through Feb. 9 to celebrate the Year of the Rat with its characters including Mickey Mouse and Minnie Mouse and target China's middle class and booming domestic tourism.
Walt Disney owns a 43% stake in Shanghai Disney Resort which has Shanghai Disneyland theme park and two hotels with a total of 1,220 rooms.
The impact on businesses is set to increase as China discourages locals from gathering in crowded places. It has already stepped up measures to contain the virus, with public transport suspensions in 10 cities, the shutting of temples and closing the Forbidden City, Beijing's most famous tourist attraction.
Japan's Fast Retailing Co Ltd said on Friday it has temporarily closed 17 Uniqlo stores in Wuhan. China is a key growth market for the company which faces a saturated market and weak consumer spending in Japan.",business

BlackRock Inc. founder and CEO Larry Fink this week said the company will shift how investments are allocated and exit stocks that “ present a high sustainability-related risk, ” including from some fossil fuel projects.

The overhaul by the No. 1 asset manager in the world, with nearly $ 7 trillion in investments, was announced in Fink’ s annual letter, which could be a watershed moment for the investment community. Fink also pledged BlackRock would vote against management teams that are not making progress on sustainability.

Nearly five years ago, BlackRock had noted how the rising impact of climate change was impacting investments. However, the firm’ s estimable sponsorship of global oil and natural gas projects is not ending in the near term, and it will in fact remain one of the top investors in energy projects.

“ Under any scenario, the energy transition will still take decades, ” Fink wrote. “ Despite recent rapid advances, the technology does not yet exist to cost-effectively replace many of today’ s essential uses of hydrocarbons. We need to be mindful of the economic, scientific, social and political realities of the energy transition.

“ Governments and the private sector must work together to pursue a transition that is both fair and just; we can not leave behind parts of society, or entire countries in developing markets, as we pursue the path to a low-carbon world. ”

However, the reasoning to withdraw from riskier investments has become clear, Fink said in the letter.

“ Climate change is almost invariably the top issue that clients around the world raise with BlackRock, ” he wrote. “ From Europe to Australia, South America to China, Florida to Oregon, investors are asking how they should modify their portfolios. And because capital markets pull future risk forward, we will see changes in capital allocation more quickly than we see changes to the climate itself…

“ In the near future — and sooner than most anticipate — there will be a significant reallocation of capital, ” he said. “ The evidence on climate risk is compelling investors to reassess core assumptions about modern finance…Even if only a fraction of the science is right today, this is a much more structural, long-term crisis. ”

More fund offerings also are to focus on environmental, social and governance ( ESG) initiatives.

BlackRock intends to double ESG exchange-traded fund offerings to 150 over the next few years, “ including sustainable versions of flagship index products, so that clients have more choice for how to invest their money. ”

The dynamic “ will accelerate as the next generation takes the helm of government and business ” as CEOs and chief investment officers ( CIO), Fink wrote. “ As trillions of dollars shift to millennials over the next few decades, as they become CEOs and CIOs, as they become the policymakers and heads of state, they will further reshape the world’ s approach to sustainability. ”

BlackRock earlier this month joined Climate Action 100+, a group of asset managers pushing fossil fuel producers to detail how they plan to meet carbon dioxide reduction targets laid out in the 2015 United Nations ( UN) global climate accord. In 2019, the group pressured BP plc to describe how its strategy aligned with those goals, and last May, almost all shareholders ( 99%) voted in favor to mesh goals with the UN agreement.

BlackRock’ s “ investment conviction is that sustainability and climate-integrated portfolios can provide better risk-adjusted returns to investors, ” Fink said. “ And with the impact of sustainability on investment returns increasing, we believe that sustainable investing is the strongest foundation for client portfolios going forward. ”

The world is “ facing the ultimate long-term problem, ” wrote Fink. “ We don’ t yet know which predictions about the climate will be most accurate, nor what effects we have failed to consider. But there is no denying the direction we are heading. Every government, company and shareholder must confront climate change. ”

Also Tuesday, the Global Association of Risk Professionals ( GARP) said it has launched a certificate in sustainability and climate risk to help professionals understand and manage the potential economic and operational impacts of a changing climate on their organizations.

“ As businesses start to recognize climate change as a financial risk, managers will increasingly need to add climate risk management to their skill sets — not only those working in finance but also in disciplines such as supply chain management, operations and technology, ” said GARP Risk Institute Co-President Jo Paisley.

606,Scientists still searching for causes of mysterious pneumonia outbreak in China,"Scientists are still trying to analyse a new strain of coronavirus that caused a pneumonia outbreak in China, with around 300 people infected and six people dead as of Tuesday.
The outbreak started in Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei Province in December. The World Health Organisation reported Monday that cases have been found in Beijing and Shenzen, adding to last week’ s confirmed cases in Thailand and Japan from people who had travelled from Wuhan.
The WHO refers to the unknown virus as novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV.
The WHO states the most likely source of this 2019-nCoV is an animal, and there is some limited human-to-human transmission between those in close contact. Scientists have yet to find the first animal that transmitted it to humans.
The first case of 2019-nCov came from Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan. On December 31, China reported 27 people had suffered from symptoms of pneumonia such as fever and difficulty breathing, and there were signs of abnormal infiltration in the patients’ lungs.
The Chinese government closed the market to prevent the spread of the disease.
Novel coronavirus ( nCoV) is a virus from coronavirus family. It’ s a close relative to MERS-CoV and SARS.
Wuhan novel coronavirus ( nCoV) is a new strain of coronavirus that has never been identified by scientists on humans. The virus has not been officially named although it is known that nCoV is a member of the betacoronavirus genus in the sarbecovirus subgenus.
Genetic analysis indicates the virus has an 89% similarity to the SARS virus, which is a relative of the SARS bat virus, also a member of coronavirus. However, this does not mean nCoV comes from bats.
For instance, MERS-CoV also has a 88% genetic closeness to bat coronavirus, but MERS-CoV spreads to human through camels. Investigation on the zoonotic nCoV is still ongoing.
Common medical symptoms of coronavirus infection are fever and difficulty breathing. In severe cases, the infection can lead to pneumonia, SARS, kidney failure and even death.
This is not the first time in the last decade that a virus from an animal was reported to infect humans.
In 2012, for example, we were shocked when media reported a viral respiratory illness caused by the ( Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, or MERS‐CoV), which was first identified in Saudi Arabia. The disease caused concern on the Hajj and Umrah pilgrimages.
Five years before, the swine flu ( Influenza A/H1N1pdm) pandemic caused fatalities of more than 5,700 people globally.
In 2013, avian influenza ( Influenza A/H7N9) from China was reported to have infected 1,567 people and killed 615 there.
There is currently no vaccine available to prevent transmission. But we still can do things to prevent the disease from spreading.
The most important thing we can do for prevention is wash our hands with soap. Cleaning your hands is easy and cheap. A number of disease transmission is through hands. So, keeping our hands clean is crucial.
When you cough and sneeze, cover your nose and mouth with a tissue or with your arm ( not with your palm).
Use a mouth and nose mask when you are sick or in a public space. Dispose of the used tissue and mask in the trash and wash your hands.
Avoid contact with farm and wild animals. Cook meat and eggs thoroughly.
If you plan to visit a country where this virus is found such as China, Thailand and Japan, be careful and take care of your health. If you experience symptoms similar to those above after going to these countries, don’ t panic – go immediately to the hospital and report your conditions.",business
872,"If You Missed Out on Tesla Stock, Consider This Chinese Car Maker","Shares in electric-vehicle pioneer Tesla have been on a tear, gaining some 125% over the past three months, crushing the gains of the S & P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average. While better-than-expected third-quarter earnings were a major catalyst, growing optimism about the Chinese EV market also helped.
Tesla ( ticker: TSLA) just started delivering Model 3 vehicles built in a new Shanghai facility to customers in China.
China is the world’ s biggest market for electric cars, and growth is expected to continue. But there are more ways than just Tesla to play it. Investors frustrated about missing out on Telsa’ s epic run may want to consider looking at Chinese EV maker BYD ( 1211.Hong Kong).
“ We believe China EV [ penetration ] goes from 5% today to 10% in the next two years, ” Wedbush analyst Dan Ives told Barron’ s. “ Global EV [ penetration ] will be 7% by 2024. ”
Ives is talking about the percentage of new-car sales that will be electric. U.S. EV penetration is about 2%, less than half Chinese levels. “ China is the fuel for Tesla on EV demand, ” Ives said.
Ives doesn’ t cover BYD, but does cover Tesla and rates its shares the equivalent of Hold, with a $ 550 price target. He is optimistic about China and EV demand overall, but Tesla’ s high valuation keeps him from recommending the stock.
Tesla, after all, is now a member of the $ 100 billion market-capitalization club. There are only about 50 companies in the U.S. with market values that high. Tesla is now the second-largest car company in the world, trailing only Toyota Motor ( TM). BYD’ s market cap, conversely, is about $ 25 billion.
BYD makes more cars than Tesla does and sold about 460,000 vehicles in 2019, compared with 367,500 Tesla sold globally. Tesla, however, sells higher-end cars. It generated about $ 24 billion in 2019 sales, while BYD will take in closer to $ 18 billion.

Unlike Tesla, the Chinese auto maker sells both battery-powered and internal-combustion vehicles, and about half of BYD sales are EVs. While Tesla sells more electric cars overall, BYD’ s EV sales outpace Tesla’ s in China.
Both companies are profitable. Tesla has made money for two straight quarters and generated positive free cash flow as well. BYD has been profitable for years.
Neither stock, though, is cheap. Tesla trades for more than 80 times estimated 2020 earnings of $ 6.78 a share. BYD trades for 50 times earnings of about 92 Hong Kong cents a share, or about 12 U.S. cents.
BYD trades in Hong Kong and reports in Hong Kong dollars. The market values and sales comparisons are in U.S. dollars. BYD also trades in the U.S. as an American depositary receipt ( BYDDF). The ADRs closed Thursday at $ 5.98, down 1.3%, as the entire Chinese market sold off on coronavirus fears.
BYD is also cheaper, relatively speaking, than Tesla because its growth isn’ t as robust. BYD sales fell in 2019, while Tesla vehicle deliveries grew about 50%. But the entire Chinese new-car market declined by about 8% in 2019. Despite the dip, EV penetration increased in China year over year.
BYD has one more thing going for it: Warren Buffett. His Berkshire Hathaway ( BRK.A) owns more than 8% of the company. Buffett, however, bought a long time ago, back around 2008, when BYD shares were about one-third the price they are today.
Still, Buffett appears to believe in the future of electric cars. And, judging by Tesla’ s recent market action, most other investors do too.",business
910,'Presumptive positive ' case of coronavirus detected in Ontario,"Hi, what are you looking for?
By
Published
“ The individual is stable and is hospitalized ” the statement added, according to Reuters.
In a news conference on Saturday, Ontario’ s chief medical officer announced that a “ presumptive positive ” case of coronavirus has been confirmed at Toronto’ s Sunnybrook hospital, marking the first such case in Canada, reports Global News.
Health officials say they were made aware of the case on Saturday afternoon. The patient is a 50-year-old man who had traveled to Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the viral outbreak. The patient was said to be in stable condition. Toronto health officials say they are working closely with Canada’ s public health agency to “ prevent any spread ” of the virus.
Dr. Eileen De Villa, Toronto’ s medical officer of health, said right now, officials are focused on finding out who the patient may have come into contact with and what types of settings they may have been exposed to. It is not known when the patient came back from his visit to Wuhan.
“ It is understandable that people may be concerned with today’ s news of our first case and that people may worry, ” Dr. de Villa said in a press release, according to CTV News Canada.
“ But I assure you that based on the lessons we learned from SARS now 17 years ago, and given our experiences during the flu pandemic of 2009 and more recently, with Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome, we have learned, shared knowledge and built a stronger public health system that is ready to respond, as needed. ”
China’ s National Health Commission confirmed Saturday that the death toll from the new virus had climbed to 41, with the number of people infected rising to 1,287.

600,Coronavirus impact: Chinese tourism would be hit by prolonged outbreak,"If China's new coronavirus turns into a prolonged outbreak, the country's travel and leisure industry will likely be among the hardest hit.
News of the pneumonia-causing virus first emerged in late December in the city of Wuhan, about 700 miles south of Beijing. At least nine people have died from the disease. Authorities have also confirmed more than 400 cases, primarily in China, but other countries have also reported the illness, including the first U.S. instance overnight.
It's unclear how threatening the virus ultimately is, but the acceleration of the outbreak has evoked fears of another epidemic similar to the severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, which broke out in late 2002 in China.
The virus also comes as Chinese are expected to make about 3 billion trips for the Lunar New Year that officially kicks off Friday.
After growing 12% in 2002, China's domestic tourism growth turned negative for the first time in a decade in 2003 amid the SARS crisis, Eric Lin, head of research at UBS Securities, pointed out in a note Tuesday.
`` Valuations of tourism companies ( incl. scenic sites, hoteliers) de-rated 20-50% from peak to trough between February and June 2003, '' Lin said.
Authorities have announced measures to limit flow of people to and from Wuhan. On Tuesday, the Civil Aviation Administration of China announced that airlines should process refunds for flights to the city free of charge.
China Southern Airlines has the highest capacity exposure to Wuhan among the three big Chinese airlines, at about 3%, Goldman Sachs analyst Ben Hartwright wrote in a note published Monday.
China Eastern Airlines ' domestic capacity for Wuhan is 2.2%, while Air China's capacity is 1.3%, according to Goldman.
In fact, the analysis showed that Air China earnings are the least sensitive to a 1% change in domestic traffic volume, at 5.1%, while China Southern Airlines had roughly double the impact at 10.8%. Goldman has a buy rating on all three airline stocks.
From January 10 to February 18, Chinese are expected to take about 79 million passenger flights.
For China's economy overall, the services sector was hit the most during the SARS epidemic of 2002 and 2003, Ting Lu, Nomura's chief China economist said in a note Tuesday. He noted that China's real GDP growth dropped by 2 percentage points from 11.1% in the first quarter of 2003 to 9.1% in the second quarter, before recovering to 10% in the third quarter of that year.
“ ( Growth was) largely dragged by the tertiary sector, especially by two major subcomponents of GDP: ( 1) transport, storage, and post, and ( 2) hotel and catering services, '' he said.
China has been increasing its reliance on the services sector for growth — it accounted for 59.4% of GDP last year, versus 39% in 2003, according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics of China accessed through Wind Information.
That said, the Chinese economy is more than 6 times larger than it was in 2003.",business
184,Is Betelgeuse about to go supernova?,"Hi, what are you looking for?
By
Published
Located within the Orion constellation, Betelgeuse is a red supergiant star. At one point in astronomical history it was one of the largest stars ever discovered, although this status has since been surpassed. Nevertheless, Betelgeuse is one of the few names of astronomical objects that has crossed into public consciousness ( not least because the star is one of the brightest stars in the night sky).
The star is a distinctly reddish, semiregular variable star whose apparent magnitude varies between +0.0 and +1.3, the widest range of any known first-magnitude star. The star is located an estimated 642 light-years away from Earth.
Of concern to astronomers is the dimming of the star with Betelgeuse reportedly having faded by up to one full magnitude. Less is known about red supergiants and how long they burn for. Such stars do not last as long as stars like our Sun, because they burn their nuclear fuel much faster.
However, the star is known for going through strange and somewhat unpredictable cycles of varying light intensity.
Discussed by Phys.org, there are two schools of thought in relation to the future of the star. The first is that Betelgeuse is simply part way through a variable cycle of brightness and it will become brighter again. Some astronomers speculate that the change in brightness could be due to some sort of eruption of gas or dust, or changes in the star’ s surface brightness.
The second line of reasoning is that Betelgeuse is dying, and the end result will be a supernova. The general media have picked up on this point, indicating that the star could soon explode. However, while red supergiants generally end up exploding this cosmic event is less likely to happen any time soon – perhaps within another few hundred thousand years ( although this is relatively soon in astronomical terms).
With a supernova, according to Popular Science: “ Once they run out of helium and hydrogen as fuel, they start to build up heavier elements in their cores, causing them to implode and grow increasingly hot and dense. Ultimately, the reaction forces the star to split its outer layers out into space. ”
The research has been published on the website Astronomer’ s Telegram as a white paper. The paper is titled “ The Fainting of the Nearby Supergiant Betelgeuse ”.

In 2020, our people showed tremendous resilience, responsibility and resolve to support one another, our customers, our communities, our suppliers, and in doing so, have served our shareholders.
At S & P Global, we can’ t change the world overnight. But we can take action to affect change.
After a year that saw the dissemination of coronavirus vaccines, historic net-zero policy discussions, and the disruption of supply chains and energy markets, 2022 is likely to result in a recalibration of the global economy.
We enter 2022 with largely positive credit momentum, reflecting favorable financing conditions and a powerful economic recovery. This could be derailed if persistently high inflation pushes central banks to aggressively tighten monetary policy, triggering significant market volatility and repricing risks.
2021 brought hope for global economic growth following 2020’ s coronavirus-caused downturn, largely tied to the development and widespread deployment of COVID-19 vaccines and despite the rise of new variants.
Investment management professionals used to focus on portfolio risk and returns. We now must consider returns along three dimensions: risk, return and impact.
While the extent and effectiveness of the global response to climate change remain uncertain, one thing is very clear: Companies and investors must prepare for a range of possible outcomes with diverging transition and physical risks. We look into these risks in our latest research, which debuted at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.
“ With our SDG analytics for financial portfolios we hope we can accelerate global progress towards achieving SDGs by helping investors to understand the positive impact of investment decisions alongside traditional considerations of risk and return. The United Nations SDGs provide critical context to help investors measure their progress on a globally relevant set of ESG considerations adopted by 178 countries. This research is a part of our continued commitment to accelerating progress towards a more sustainable future. We found that the majority of companies do not report on their progress against the SDGs and if they do there is an emphasis on only positive impacts. The launch of SDG Analytics means that market participants can now have balanced view on the progress that companies are making on SDGs in this decade of action. ”
It has been four years since the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development with its 17 Sustainable Development Goals ( SDGs) was adopted at the UN Sustainable Development Summit. During this time, the SDGs have garnered widespread backing among companies and investors who have made modest progress towards aligning business strategies and capital allocation with the SDGs. While challenges prevail in transitioning to transformative action on the SDGs, several trends have emerged that suggest this action is accelerating.Investors have a growing appetite to benchmark companies against each other in terms of their SDG performance. Where disclosure is absent, other providers have built assessments, indexes and benchmarks to compare corporate action. Information providers increasingly offer investor-focused products for measuring a company’ s portfolio towards the SDGs, while indexes have emerged to help investors gain exposure to companies identified as making a contribution to the Goals. The World Benchmarking Alliance has accelerated work in this arena by planning to build science-informed league tables, starting first with a Food and Agriculture Benchmark comprising 300 companies across the food and agricultural value chain.
Trucost’ s SDG Analytics quantitatively measure the SDG alignment of a company’ s products and services, allowing investors to benchmark companies against each other in terms of their SDG performance, and offers portfolio-level metrics to measure risk exposure and SDG‑alignment.
In 2018, S & P Global assessed climate-related risks and opportunities in accordance with the recommendations from the Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures ( TCFD). Established in 2016 by the Financial Stability Board ( FSB), the TCFD developed recommendations for more effective and standardized disclosure of financially material climate-related risks and opportunities. The goal of the Task Force is to promote more informed investment and sustainable markets. Using four core elements – governance, strategy, risk management and metrics & targets – the TCFD assessment shows how an organization accounts for climate-related risks and opportunities, as well as strategies for mitigating risks and realizing opportunities.
The transition to a low carbon economy is vital for a sustainable future. In order to make progress, it is necessary that we understand the material financial implications of climate change on businesses and investments. Therefore, measurement and integration of comparable, consistent, and reliable environmental, social, and governance ( ESG) factors is fundamental to making more informed decisions to facilitate long term sustainable growth.
While the extent and effectiveness of the global response to climate change remain uncertain, one thing is very clear: Companies and investors must prepare for a range of possible outcomes with diverging transition and physical risks. This need for determined action to reduce emissions and limit the effects of climate change poses important transition risks for companies and investors through regulation, changing market dynamics, and technology, among other factors. As it stands, companies in the benchmark S & P 500 Index own physical assets across 68 countries globally—and 60% of these entities ( with a market capitalization of $ 18 trillion) hold assets that are at high risk of at least one type of climate-change physical risk. And while corporate-level resilience to both transition and physical risk varies greatly within and across sectors, S & P Global data show that heatwaves, wildfires, water stress, and hurricanes linked to increasing average global temperatures represent the biggest physical risks for companies in the S & P 500.
On the brink of irreversible climate change, a combination of ground-breaking datasets and index innovation is emerging, through which investors will have the choice to align their investments to a future climate scenario compatible with mitigating catastrophic global warming to the planet. This new breed of sustainable climate indices will not only offer solutions that intend to be impactful, but equally aim to provide investors with reduced risks from transitioning to a low-carbon economy and the consequences of physical, environmental events while capturing financial opportunities that arise.This paper describes an S & P Dow Jones Indices ( S & P DJI) concept for the eurozone region, which is aligned with the more stringent of the two new climate benchmarks: the Paris-Aligned Benchmark.
What’ s the Deal with the 2-Degree Scenario? Under the 2015 Paris Agreement, nearly 200 countries agreed to limit global warming to no more than 2 degrees Celsius by 2100, and to aim for a no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius increase. The 2-degree scenario is widely seen as the global community’ s accepted limitation of temperature growth to avoid significant and potentially catastrophic changes to the planet.
Policy changes introduced as economies adapt to climate change could wipe between $ 1.6 trillion to $ 2.3 trillion off the value of major global companies by 2025, and investors need to reflect that policy risk in their strategies, according to research conducted for the U.N.-backed group, Principles for Responsible Investment. According to an analysis by consultants Vivid Economics and Energy Transition Advisors, policy changes would reduce by 3.1% to 4.5% the value of companies on the benchmark global equity MSCI ACWI index, or the equivalent of the total value of the largest 12 to 33 companies on the London Stock Exchange's FTSE100.
The future financial and social consequences of climate change are becoming increasingly apparent to companies, investors and policy makers. Strong action to reduce emissions and limit climate change may avoid the worst physical impacts of climate change but presents significant market, technology and regulatory transition risks for market participants. Conversely, failure to adequately reduce greenhouse gas emissions may limit transition risks but will result in increasing climate change and associated physical risks.
As more and more companies and investors conclude that sustainable practices make for sustainable returns, the assessment of corporations’ environmental, social, and governance ( ESG) footprints has moved from a simple measure of corporate responsibility to an investment proposition. While this general focus on ESG policies is undeniably beneficial, companies today are presented with the additional challenge of actively planning for climate risk. With a growing consensus around climate science, companies and investors must plan for a number of different scenarios, depending on the extent and impact of global climate change. However, an absence of shared terminology, benchmarks, and policies threaten to stymie investors and companies as they attempt to account for climate risk.
Global infrastructure spending has remained resilient in an environment of financial instability, underpinned mainly by interest from private sector investors. Private investors seeking long-term, stable returns are keen to fund infrastructure projects ranging from energy, to transport, to water infrastructure. These investors are providing support to governments facing a growing infrastructure funding gap. Yet, the sector is now awakening to the threats and opportunities that sustainability brings to realizing this long-term source of finance. Long-term climate risks are unlikely to leave any sector untouched as governments worldwide seek to maintain warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius under the 2015 Paris Agreement. This may force infrastructure projects to address energy use concerns, particularly as urban infrastructure consumes approximately two-thirds of global energy. Further, concerns over the recoupling of resource consumption and economic growth continue to grow. This adds pressure to address the resource-intensity of infrastructure often associated with the `` take, make, and dispose '' model under the linear economy.
Insurance coverage for some risks is becoming rarer and more costly as climate change alters the risk landscape, according to Zurich Insurance Group AG's chief risk officer. Speaking to S & P Global Market Intelligence following the release of the World Economic Forum's 2020 Global Risks Report, Peter Giger said certain perils are becoming increasingly expensive, and that while those price increases are justifiable, they are hitting communities affected by climate change.",business
257,"WHO says new China coronavirus could spread, warns hospitals worldwide","GENEVA – There may have been limited human-to-human transmission of a new coronavirus in China within families, and it is possible there could be a wider outbreak, the World Health Organization ( WHO) said on Tuesday.
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can cause infections ranging from the common cold to SARS.
A Chinese woman has been quarantined in Thailand with a mystery strain of coronavirus, Thai authorities said on Monday, the first time the virus has been detected outside China.
In all, 41 cases of pneumonia have been reported in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, which preliminary lab tests cited by state media showed could be from a new type of coronavirus, and one patient has died. There have since been no new cases or deaths, Wuhan health authorities said on Tuesday.
“ From the information that we have it is possible that there is limited human-to-human transmission, potentially among families, but it is very clear right now that we have no sustained human-to-human transmission, ” said Maria Van Kerkhove, acting head of WHO’ s emerging diseases unit.
The WHO is, however, preparing for the possibility that there could be a wider outbreak, she told a Geneva news briefing. “ It is still early days, we don’ t have a clear clinical picture. ”
Some types of the virus cause less serious diseases, while others — like the one that causes MERS — are far more severe.
The U.N. agency has given guidance to hospitals worldwide about infection prevention and control in case the new virus spreads. There is no specific treatment for the new virus, but anti-virals are being considered and could be “ re-purposed, ” Van Kerkhove said.
With Chinese New Year approaching on Jan. 25, when many Chinese tourists visit Thailand, the WHO called on Thai authorities, the public and holidaymakers to be on alert.
Richard Brow, the agency’ s representative in Thailand, said anyone with a fever and cough who had spent time in Wuhan should get checked out by a health worker.",tech
749,"Lam courts Davos elite with dim sum, as Hong Kong scrambles to contain virus","With dim sum, cocktails and gold chocolate coins, Hong Kong wrapped up its Davos charm offensive confident the financial hub is back on track, even as officials fly home to tackle a deadly flu-like virus.
Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam arrives back to Hong Kong on Saturday, the first day of the Year of the Rat, to face with what could be a perfect storm - an outbreak of coronavirus, lingering protests and an economic downturn.
Wearing a dress and pink jacket, Lam appeared unfazed as she mingled with some of the 200 business and political leaders on the Hong Kong Night of her trip, which her deputy Matthew Cheung described as a “ very important diplomatic visit ”.
Flanked by her commerce secretary Edward Yau, Lam listened as HKEX chairwoman Laura Cha reinforced a message that “ Team HK ” delivered to A-list global investors, corporate and political leaders at the World Economic Forum this week.
“ Last year we had experienced one of the global, big black swans that captured world attention, ” Cha said, referring to anti-government protests that plunged the Chinese-ruled city into its biggest crisis in decades.
“ Every time we came out of a crisis... we became stronger. We are resilient and we will come out of the current one as well, ” she said. “ Our message tonight is clear. Hong Kong is open for business. ”
Cha’ s message was echoed by Hong Kong officials including commerce secretary Yau, HKEX chief executive Charles Li and Beijing-backed Lam, whose approval rate is around 14%, the lowest of any post-colonial Hong Kong leader.
As the delegation spoke in a conference room decorated with red lanterns at the Ameron Hotel in the Swiss mountain resort, officials in Hong Kong were scrambling to contain the spread of a coronavirus that threatens to inflict even more pain.
There are two confirmed cases of the virus in Hong Kong, where events have been canceled and authorities are considering extending school holidays to contain the infection, which has killed 26 people in mainland China.
The rapid spread of coronavirus has rattled global markets and prompted travel warnings, with authorities concerned it could spread rapidly as hundreds of millions of Chinese travel to be with relatives over the Lunar New Year.
Some social media posts slammed Lam for going to Davos amid the health crisis, with one reading: “ Clearly going to Davos to promote herself is more important than staying in Hong Kong to fight # WuhanCoronavirus. ”
The protesters are now also calling for a ban on all mainland Chinese travelers into Hong Kong.
Lam acknowledged in Davos that the rapid flow of people across the border with mainland China made Hong Kong vulnerable, although the government has not yet implemented controls.
She said on Thursday in Davos that Hong Kong had learned valuable lessons from an outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome ( SARS), which killed nearly 300 people in the former British colony in 2003.
“ I am cautiously confident that the system we have built up over these years and well tested over these years, will take us out of this current problem, ” Lam said.
In Hong Kong, the Hospital Authority Employees Alliance said incompetent handling by the government was responsible for the confirmed cases in the city and slammed authorities for not implementing border controls.

555,What the 2003 SARS epidemic tells us about the potential impact of China’ s coronavirus on oil and metals,"The outbreak of coronavirus in China has led to concerns over a slowdown in the nation’ s economy and put pressure on oil and industrial metals prices on bets for potentially weaker demand for the commodities.
However, if the 2002-2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic, known as SARS, may serve as a guide, the overall impact of the virus outbreak may be modest and short lived on the global economy, as well as on the commodities sector.
“ Even the significant economic disruption related to SARS turned out to be temporary and experts expect this disease to be less deadly and better contained, ” said Jennifer McKeown, head of the Global Economics Service at Capital Economics, in report dated Wednesday.
As of midnight Tuesday there were 440 confirmed cases of coronavirus in China and at least nine people have died,
according to the Associated Press
. Cases have also been confirmed in Thailand, Japan, South Korea, the U.S. and Taiwan. The
SARS outbreak roughly 17 years ago
saw more than 8,000 cases in 26 countries and killed nearly 800 people.
After news of a single coronavirus case
diagnosed in the United States emerged Tuesday
, prices for industrial metals such as silver and copper finished lower. On Wednesday, silver
US: SIH20
prices have moved up a bit to settle at $ 17.828 an ounce, up 0.1% for the session, though copper
US: HGH20
continued its decline, losing 1% to finish at $ 2.765 a pound. Oil prices
US: CLH20
UK: BRNH20
,
meanwhile,
moved sharply lower Wednesday
, with some analysts attributing weakness to the possibility that the virus will curb travel and result in less fuel consumption.
Industrial metals can sell off and test or move below the 2019 lows if China’ s coronavirus becomes an epidemic, said Chintan Karnani, chief market analyst at Insignia Consultants.
The virus will “ result in less consumer spending in the short term, ” he said. Depending on the scope of the spread, “ industrial metals can fall between 3% to 5% anytime. ”
Jeff Klearman, portfolio manager at exchange-traded fund issuer GraniteShares, said that prices for base metals, which copper and zinc, would decline if the coronavirus becomes widespread and weaken global economic growth. He specifically mentioned copper as China accounts for about half of global demand for the metal.
Crude-oil prices would decline under that scenario as well, as oil touches “ almost all phases of the economy, ” he said. “ A slowdown in industrial production, air travel and gasoline consumption would lead to less demand pitting against ample supply. ”
But Karnani pointed out that a few hundred people getting the disease is “ not an epidemic ” in the world’ s most populous nation. The developments over the next three weeks will be “ crucial, ” he added.
The spread of the virus comes ahead of the Lunar New Year celebration, which begins on Jan. 25 and can last through to the Feb. 8 Lantern Festival. It’ s a significant travel period for the Chinese, raising the potential for further spread of the illness.
“ The recent outbreak of a new coronavirus in China has raised questions on its potential impact on the oil and jet fuel markets, ” analysts Damien Courvalin and Callum Bruce of Goldman Sachs wrote in research note dated Tuesday.
“ Translating the estimated SARS demand impact into 2020 volumes ” leads to a potential 260,000 barrels per day “ negative shock to global oil demand on average, ” including a 170,000 barrel-per-day loss of jet fuel demand, the Goldman Sachs analysts said. These demand concerns will counter worries around supply disruptions in Libya, Iran and Iraq, they added.
The total oil demand loss would translate into a modest $ 2.90 per barrel impact on oil prices, based on Goldman Sachs pricing model, the analysts said.
Uncertainty surrounding the SARS epidemic had “ left market and forecasters initially pricing and assuming a much larger impact than eventually occurred, ” they said. Oil was down nearly 20% at its trough during that epidemic, but the “ elevated level of fear ultimately subsided when the pace of new cases reported slowed, with a total duration of the epidemic outbreak of [ approximately ] 5 months, before a quick recovery in regional activity. ”
Given that, many analysts believe the impact from the spread of the coronavirus will be less significant, as well as temporary.
For now, the spread of the coronavirus across Asia into the U.S. is “ clearly a major public health concern, ” but Capital Economics expects that its economic effects will be “ modest, ” said McKeown.
“ Based on the information we have, we do not expect the coronavirus to have more than a temporary effect on global GDP, which is likely to be made up once the disease is brought under control, ” she said. “ And while there have already been some effects on financial markets... we suspect that these too will be short-lived. ”",business

NGI The Weekly Gas Market Report | E & P | Markets | NGI All News Access
Editor’ s Note: This is one of a 14-piece series NGI undertook as the energy industry readied for the new year, with Lower 48 natural gas and oil supply continuing to surge in an uncertain environment as liquefied natural gas exports ramp up, Mexico markets remain shrouded and stakeholders demand more value. Get your complimentary copy of NGI’ s 2020 Special Report today.

The natural gas and oil sector is coming to grips with a bevy of uncertainties this year, as capital markets are drying up, investors are fleeing and the global community voices increasing concerns about fossil fuels.

Energy industry prognosticators see a foggy 2020, potentially a repeat of sorts from 2019, with a mild increase in capital expenditures ( capex) for the exploration and production ( E & P) sector and continued pain for oilfield services ( OFS).

The Evercore ISI analyst team led by James West recently compiled the 2020 Global E & P Spending Outlook, an annual sampling in which data was collected from more than 250 oil and gas operators of all stripes — publics, privates, domestic and internationally focused, from the smallest of the moms-and-pops to the supermajors.

The “ tale of two markets ” is arriving this year, West said. The pain in North America ( NAM) “ is being felt all around, ” with more than 32 bankruptcy filings by North American E & Ps last year amounting to around $ 13 billion in debt.

Investors also are exiting the sector. A dollar invested in the OSX Index 20 years ago would have fetched “ an extra penny in your pocket, compared to nearly $ 5 for the S & P 500, ” West said. “ This clear disconnect has brought energy weightings in the S & P 500 to between 4-5% versus a stunning 15% this past decade. ”

NAM operators are in search of a new normal, as the pullback in drilling and completion activity started earlier last year than in 2018, and the decline in the rig count was steeper than most operators had expected, the survey indicated.

After increasing by 46% in 2017 and 20% in 2018, NAM capex is set to decline for two consecutive years, with 2019 and 2020 both expected to be down 6%, respondents said.

“ The NAM market is best described as a muddle in 2020, driven by the continued backdrop of lower for longer spending and activity levels by operators, ” West said. Consolidation also has had an impact.

A pickup in activity levels in NAM is expected as new budgets are reset, “ but visibility is poor and management teams are uncertain. ”

E & Ps also have sobered up about price assumptions. When the survey was conducted late last year, respondents were expecting 2020 crude to average $ 53.75/bbl West Texas Intermediate and $ 58/bbl Brent. Recently, with increased instability in Iran and Iraq, oil prices have been moving higher.

The latest survey still “ denotes a marked shift in thinking versus prior years, and we believe that a relative lack of funding is also another driving factor as the upstream learns to sustain itself on internal cash flows, ” West said.

Nearly one-quarter ( 27%) of those surveyed said they would not increase capex, “ no matter how much pricing increases, which we found to be noteworthy. ” One-half said they would “ neither increase nor decrease their capex plans under any price scenario. ”

The E & P executives also are harboring a more bearish view on natural gas compared with 2019. For 2020, the average price deck forecast for natural gas is $ 2.37/Mcf, which is 6.9% below Evercore’ s 2020 estimate.

By comparison, Goldman Sachs is expecting Henry Hub to average $ 2.20/Mcf this year, with an average price of $ 2.50 in 2021, and $ 2.75 in 2022 and 2023. The U.S. Energy Information Administration expects Henry Hub to average $ 2.45/MMBtu in 2020, down 14 cents from the 2019 average.

RBN Energy LLC President Rusty Braziel, in the eighth year of posting prognostications, said the shale/tight resource era has not ended, “ but it is going to be much more difficult to get projects done. ”

Last year saw a few “ profound market shifts that will be with us into 2020 and beyond, ” he said.

For one thing, “ Wall Street has soured on anything to do with oil and gas, and that’ s tightened capital markets for both drilling and infrastructure. But it is deeper than that. ”

The energy industry is “ shell-shocked from what seems like a continuous cycle of capacity constraints, the need for long-term capacity commitments, overbuilds, low prices and collapsing price differentials. ”

The entire infrastructure development process also has slowed, and E & Ps “ are more inclined to deal with capacity issues in a few years rather than sign up for a new project today. That’ s the reality of the shale era as we enter the new decade, ” Braziel said.

Morningstar Commodities Research’ s Sandy Fielden, who directs oil and products research, said “ a sense of shale fatigue lingers in the air at the start of 2020, with drilling slowing and a challenging investment environment for producers. ”

As Lower 48 oil output continues to grow, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC) and allies have protected prices by reducing their production. However, “ the threat of excess supply has pushed forward markets into a contango structure with December 2021 futures settling $ 8/bbl below the prompt contract, ” Fielden said. “ That leaves U.S. producers and the crude market vulnerable to slower economic growth. ”

Raymond James & Associates Inc.’ s analyst team led by Praveen Narra said strip prices suggest the U.S. rig count likely has bottomed.

The final quarter of 2019 marks the trough for rig activity, with the U.S. count “ up 6.1% from here and fracture demand up 8.1%, ” Narra said.

“ Our strip rig count…is based on a bottoms-up, basin-by-basin approach, which forecasts which companies will be running rigs and where. This forecast considers announced capital plans, public E & P budgets, oil and gas breakevens in major plays, as well as the current futures strip prices.

“ Overall, we currently estimate the total U.S. rig count will average 910 in 2020, a decrease from the 2019 average of 945. ” The 2020 average horizontal rig count forecast calls for a 45-rig increase in the next 12 months, with 30 rigs destined for the Permian Basin, or 66% share of incremental rigs.

Capital discipline is “ easy for producers to talk about ” when West Texas Intermediate ( WTI) is trading at $ 50-55/bbl, “ but a lot harder for investors to believe at $ 60-plus, ” Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. ( TPH) analysts said.

“ One of the dominant themes of our client conversations following the Iran news late last week was the potential for added activity and hedges given a higher 2020 curve, which now stands at $ 61 WTI. Early feedback from coverage companies appears to be in line with our thoughts that cash flow uplifts will flow to balance sheet repair/increased shareholder returns rather than incremental production growth. ”

From a hedging standpoint, producers are expected to lock in solid prices for 2020 and 2021.

With earnings season set to begin later this month, “ it’ s imperative that companies stand firm to this message on 4Q2019 conference calls when the majority of 2020 plans are revealed as capital discipline remains a prerequisite for long-term money to return to the space. ”

The TPH team also reflected on the past decade. At the end of 2009, the U.S. rig count was on its way to 2,000-plus, while the Haynesville Shale was the second most active U.S. play after the Permian.

“ Part of the beauty of embarking upon a new decade is knowing that there will be geopolitical and industry events and technological innovations which are ( today) predictably unpredictable, but which will notably influence global supply/demand balances across the energy value chain, ” the TPH team said.

“ With North American E & P operators still relatively new, and thus enthusiastic, converts to the religion of capital discipline and value over ( production) volume, and with the ( short-term) threat of a sub- $ 50/bbl WTI oil price increasingly in the rearview mirror, we like the backdrop for generalist investors to find their way back to our energy industry as the new year unfolds. ”

The building blocks were set last year as E & Ps improved costs and reduced spending.

“ Our positioning in 2019 was to avoid gas and stay overweight large cap oil versus smaller peers, and going into 2020 we’ re not quite ready to shift that message — at least through the first half of the coming year, ” the TPH team said. “ To sum it up, while we wait for an improved gas macro outlook, we’ re betting that capital inflows hit the larger-cap oily names first… ”

Low commodity prices may limit opportunities for E & Ps to build cash flow this year too, according to Moody’ s Investors Service. The OFS sector in turn then could see revenue and cash flow shrink as customers retreat, said senior credit officer Amol Joshi. “ Tepid ” activity in turn also may upend midstream opportunities.

Because energy operators have to attract equity investors, “ many are returning excess cash flow to shareholders rather than reinvesting in their businesses to grow at any cost. But equity investor returns have yet to improve ” since oil prices crashed in late 2014, Joshi said.

Investor sentiment has soured even more since mid-2019 on continued U.S. supply growth, the risk of renewed economic uncertainty and tariff wars.

Meanwhile, environmental, social and governance ( ESG) goals are becoming de rigueur, as operators acquiesce to investors by pledging to reduce carbon emissions and improve the places where they work.

Instituting ESG goals is a must, Joshi said, as “ capital providers with environmental or social directives are also actively reducing their exposures to energy companies, limiting the capital available for such companies. ”

935,"Cisco retools CCNA, CCNP and CCIE, adds DevNet Associate and Professional certifications","Cisco announced upgrades to its certification and training program on Monday. The program now features Cisco Certified Network Associate ( CCNA), Cisco Certified Network Professional ( CCNP), and Cisco Certified Internetwork Expert ( CCIE) written exams, as well as brand new Cisco DevNet Associate Cisco DevNet Professional exams, according to a blog post.
SEE: The driving force behind IT salaries in Global Knowledge's report ( free PDF) ( TechRepublic)
Certifications are sweeping the IT enterprise, with 85% of professionals earning their most recent certification in the last 12 months, a Global Knowledge report found. These certifications not only help sharpen IT skills, but can earn these professionals more money and sought-after jobs.
`` Certifications have been a way to validate yourself to others, '' said Joe Clarke, distinguished services engineer at Cisco. `` It's a door opener; it says, ' I have achieved this level. ' ''
Candidates who have certifications on their resume are displaying that they have up-to-date skills and can demonstrate those skills, which is appealing for hiring managers, Clarke said.
As a major certification provider for the past 26 years, Cisco attempts to offer the most relevant certifications that reflect the evolving tech landscape. With networking significantly shifting over the past few years, the company said it decided it was time to reflect those changes in its certifications.
`` This huge trend around software-defined networking permeated its way into everything, '' Clarke said. `` We have a software-defined data centers, then ACI ( Application Centric Infrastructure), and then we had this whole push towards software-defined WAN, and now software-defined access layer networks.
`` It's not enough anymore just to do these incremental, evolutionary steps, '' Clarke noted. `` The fact that the network engineer has to be more software-aware and embrace more software. ''
The updated CCNA program helps prepare associate-level IT professionals for a successful career in networking by adding security, automation and programmability to the course. The certification also covers network fundamentals, network access, IP connectivity, and IP services.
Before the update, Cisco had 10 different CCNA tracks. This new CCNA certification presents a unified, single version of those 10 originals, while incorporating modern skills employers look for in networking engineers, Clarke said.
`` We started asking hiring managers, what is it you really expect from an associate-level professional? We found that they wanted someone who was a little broader in networking, someone who could be a little more malleable in different areas of the network, '' Clarke said.
`` The new, single CCNA focuses on routing and switching; it focuses on security, because security is so integral to networking; and, we wanted to start to introduce those fundamentals of programming and automation, because any network that's being at scale is going to get back candidate, '' Clarke added.
The CCNP is a more advanced version of a CCNA, geared toward more experienced network engineers, who want to bolster their skills and look ahead, Clarke said.
Within the Cisco courses, professionals at this level can choose between five tracks to focus on, including enterprise, collaboration, data center, security, or service provider.
`` The new Cisco NP has two exams. They used to have varying numbers of exams depending on the track, '' Clarke said. The first exam taps into the student's specialized track, and the other is a technology core foundation applied across all five tracks. ''
`` You don't need any prerequisites anymore, '' Clarke said. `` If I jumped in and I go from my, let's say, CCNP Enterprise, I 'll walk out of that with three certifications: Two specialists, one for the technology core and my concentration, and the CCNP. ''
The CCIE is the expert-level certification for network engineers, also offering the five specialty tracks included on NP.
The previous IE certification had a written component, but the new certification includes the same technology core offered for the NP to serve as the foundational exam, Clarke said.
`` However, whereas in NP I could take either the concentration or the core first, in IE, I must first pass the technology core in a given technology space and then I can go and sit for an eight-hour lab, '' Clarke said.
`` The new eight- hour lab consists of a three-hour low-level design component upfront, a situation or scenario-based design, and then five hours of implementation, operation, optimization, and troubleshooting, '' he added.
`` We wanted to thread software through every one of our certifications for the network engineer, '' Clarke said. `` It's critical that the network engineer now embrace software as a means of delivering reliable, likable, scalable network solutions. ''
The new DevNet Associate certification validates the emerging skills of software developers, DevOps engineers, automation specialists, and other software professionals.
The associate-level program requires one exam and focuses on understanding and using APIs, Cisco platforms and development, application development and security, and infrastructure and automation, Clarke said.
The DevNet Professional is the more advanced certification, helping developers master design and debugging with Cisco APIs and platforms.
`` The Professional [ certification ] structurally looks just like the network engineer [ certification ]: You have a core exam and a number of concentrations, '' Clarke said.
`` This person might very well be a team leader of software development; they have five or more years of experience designing and developing software, '' Clarke added.
All programs are currently available for enrollment, however, the CCIE lab exam centers are temporarily closed, in light of the coronavirus outbreak.

629,China's Wuhan coronavirus: CDC advisers concerned about lack of basic information,"
Advisers to the CDC say a lack of data from China about the Wuhan coronavirus is curtailing international efforts to quell the outbreak.
While the advisers commended the Chinese researchers for mapping the virus's genome in just a few weeks, they said there's a glaring lack of basic epidemiological evidence about who's getting infected with the virus and how it's spreading.
`` This is Epi 101, '' said
Dr. William Schaffner
, medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases and a longtime CDC adviser. `` I don't want to denigrate our Chinese colleagues, but when information is not presented clearly, you have to wonder. ''
Wuhan virus spreads as China puts cities on lockdown and scraps New Year celebrations
The outbreak has grown quickly. The first cases were reported to the
World Health Organization
on December 31, and by January 3, there were 44 cases in China. Now, not even three weeks later, there are more then 600 cases, and the outbreak has spread to Thailand, South Korea, Japan, Singapore, Saudi Arabia and the United States, where there is one case.
The CDC advisers said since there's no vaccine against this new virus, public health efforts, such as catching cases early and instituting
quarantine
rules, are crucial. But they say it's hard to know whom to quarantine and for how long without knowing how people are getting infected, at what point and for how long they're capable of spreading the virus to others.

`` This information is critically important. It tells you how to control the outbreak and what to worry about and whom to worry about, '' said
Dr. Paul Offit,
a specialist in pediatric infectious diseases at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, and a longtime CDC adviser.
Disease detectives hunting down more information about'super spreader ' of Wuhan coronavirus
At a press conference in Beijing on Wednesday, Li Bin, the vice minister of China's National Health Commission said his country is `` committed to public disclosure of information as well as international exchanges and cooperation. ''
`` We will disclose information on the outbreak in a timely, open and transparent manner, objectively reporting outbreak developments, '' Li said, adding that China will share information with the WHO and other countries `` on outbreak monitoring, investigation and treatment as well as risk assessment opinions in a timely manner so that we can discuss and improve measures together. ''
Crucial questions left unanswered
Wuhan coronavirus is not yet a public health emergency of international concern, WHO says
On Thursday, Chinese authorities presented top officials from the World Health Organization with new epidemiological information that revealed an increase in the number of cases, suspected cases, affected provinces and the proportion of deaths that are occurring. They reported fourth-generation cases in Wuhan -- meaning one infected person can give the virus to a second person, who can give it to a third person, who can give it to a fourth person. They reported second-generation cases outside of Wuhan, as well as some clusters outside Hubei province, according to a WHO media release.
But the CDC advisers said that's not nearly enough. They said there are very specific pieces of information about the spread of the Wuhan coronavirus that are still missing.
Among them: Of more than 600 cases, how many contracted the virus from handling animals at the market where the virus emerged and how many contracted it from people who had been at the market?
Among those who never went to the market, are they family members of the people who got infected at the market or colleagues who sit next to each other at work? Or maybe they don't know anyone who is sick and it's unclear where they caught it?
Looking at that chain of infection, are people spreading the disease before they have symptoms, while they have symptoms or after they 've recovered?
Wuhan: Inside the Chinese city at the center of the coronavirus outbreak
Answers to those questions would help officials decide how long to isolate sick patients and who needs to be quarantined to see if they do develop symptoms.
`` You 've got to understand how this spreads, '' said
Patricia Stinchfield
, vice president of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases and a CDC adviser. `` And you want to know what people's symptoms are and who's having mild versus severe disease. How many people are hospitalized? How many in the intensive care unit? ''
Stinchfield
, a pediatric nurse practitioner and senior director of infection control at Children's Minnesota and Schaffner, an infectious disease doctor at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, are both liaison members of the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. Offit was a voting member of that group from 1998-2003 and has been on CDC working groups since then.

A CDC spokesperson declined to comment for this story.
A WHO official said he understands the frustration about a lack of epidemiological information, but that it's possible that some CDC staffers know the answers to some of these questions and just haven't shared them with the advisers or the general public.
Dr. David Heymann, chair of the
WHO's Strategic and Technical Advisory Group for Infectious Hazards
, said at the beginning of an outbreak, sometimes different groups know different pieces of information.
`` The CDC might have access to info that WHO doesn't have, and vice versa, '' he said.

`` The more you know, the more comprehensive you can be in defining and controlling what the issue is, '' he said.

28,Top Iran commander Qasem Soleimani killed in US strike on Baghdad,"Hi, what are you looking for?
By

Top Iranian commander Qasem Soleimani was killed Friday in a US strike on Baghdad's international airport, Iran and the US confirmed, in a dramatic escalation of tensions between the two countries.
The Pentagon said US President Donald Trump ordered Soleimani's `` killing, '' after a pro-Iran mob this week laid siege to the US embassy.
Following Soleimani's death, Trump tweeted an image of the US flag without any further explanation.
The pre-dawn developments mark the most major escalation yet in a feared proxy war between Iran and the US on Iraqi soil.
Early Friday, a volley of missiles hit Baghdad's international airport, striking a convoy belonging to the Hashed al-Shaabi, an Iraqi paramilitary force with close ties to Iran.
Just a few hours later, Iranian state television carried a statement by the Revolutionary Guard Corps saying Soleimani `` was martyred in an attack by America on Baghdad airport this morning. ''
The Hashed confirmed that both Soleimani and its deputy chief Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis were killed in what it said was a `` US strike. ''
`` The deputy head of the Hashed, Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, and head of the Quds Force, Qasem Soleimani, were killed in a US strike that targeted their car on the Baghdad International Airport road, '' it said.
The Hashed is a network of mostly-Shiite armed units, many of whom have close ties to Tehran but which have been officially incorporated into Iraq's state security forces.
The units joined forces to fight the Islamic State group in 2014, after many of them built up years of fighting experience during Iraq's war years, including against the US.
- 'Major decapitation strike ' -
Muhandis was the Hashed's deputy chief but widely recognised as the real shot-caller within the group.
Soleimani headed the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps ' Quds Force and also served as Iran's pointman on Iraq, visiting the country in times of turmoil.
Both were sanctioned by the United States.
The Pentagon said Soleimani had been `` actively developing plans to attack American diplomats and service members in Iraq and throughout the region. ''
It said it took `` decisive defensive action to protect US personnel abroad by killing Qasem Soleimani, '' but did not specify how.
Phillip Smyth, a US-based specialist in Shiite armed groups, told AFP the strike would have `` bigger '' ramifications than the 2011 US operation that killed Al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden and the 2019 American raid that killed Islamic State group Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.
`` In terms of a decapitation strike, what just happened is the most major decapitation strike that the US has ever pulled off, '' said Smyth.
`` There is no comparison, '' he added.
The developments come after an unprecedented attack on the US mission in Baghdad.
A mob of Hashed supporters surrounded the US embassy on Tuesday in outrage over American air strikes that killed 25 fighters from the network's hardline Kataeb Hezbollah faction, which is backed by Iran.
The US had acted in response to a rocket attack days earlier that had killed an American contractor working in Iraq.
Trump had blamed Iran for a spate of rocket attacks targeting US forces as well as the siege at the embassy, saying: `` They will pay a very BIG PRICE! This is not a Warning, it is a Threat. ''
On Thursday, US Secretary of Defence Mark Esper told reporters there could be more attacks from Iran-backed groups but vowed American forces would respond.
`` We are prepared to exercise self-defense, and we are prepared to deter further bad behavior from these groups, all of which are sponsored, directed and resourced by Iran, '' he said.
- Oil prices soar -
Ties between the US and Iran have deteriorated since Washington pulled out of the landmark nuclear deal with Tehran in 2018.
It then reimposed crippling sanctions on Iran, aiming to choke off its oil exports.
Oil prices soared following Friday's attack, with Brent surging 4.4 percent to $ 69.16 and WTI jumping 4.3 percent to 63.84.
But the attack threatens to destabilise Iraq, which has close political and military ties with both Tehran and Washington.
The United States led the 2003 invasion against then-dictator Saddam Hussein and has worked closely with Iraqi officials since.
But its influence has waned compared with that of Tehran, which has carefully crafted personal ties with Iraqi politicians and armed factions, even during Saddam's reign.
Iraqi officials have warned in recent months that their country could be used as an arena for score-settling between Iran and the US.

387,The Wuhan coronavirus likely made the jump from animals to humans — Quartz,"As of today ( Jan. 20), a new respiratory virus in China has sickened more than 200 people across six cities. Cases have also been reported in South Korea, Japan, and Thailand. The head of the Chinese health authority confirmed that it appears the virus can be spread from person to person, putting health authorities on high alert ahead of the Lunar New Year, which is accompanied by some of the year’ s biggest travel days in the region.
The first cases of the virus appeared in the mainland city Wuhan late last year. Health officials say the virus, which isn’ t named yet, causes a fever and shortness of breath, which has led to pneumonia in some cases and three deaths so far.
Virologists studying this recent outbreak have identified the culprit as a coronavirus, which gets its name for the protein protrusions that decorate the outside of the virus like a crown. At first glance, coronaviruses are unremarkable: They’ re common among animals, and in humans cause illnesses similar to the common cold, which are usually not severe. But coronaviruses have one trait that makes them particularly hard to contain: They’ re zoonotic, meaning they have the ability to jump between animals and humans.
Viruses are essentially genetic code encapsulated in a protein shell, and they have three goals in life ( if we can call them alive): Find another life form they’ re compatible with, copy themselves like crazy, and jump into the next host. Typically, viruses are only capable of invading a certain type of cell, like for example those that line the respiratory tracts of pigs. That’ s why viruses that make animals sick usually won’ t make their way to humans.
That’ s not the case with coronaviruses and other zoonotic microbes. These viruses have a single strand of genetic material, called RNA, which means it mutates easily as it copies itself. ( More complex lifeforms, like us and animals, have double-stranded genetic material called DNA. The mirroring strand can act like a copy editor.) Most of the time, these mutations are useless—but every now and then, they can enable a pathogen to infect a new species, as Ben Longdon, a virologist at the University of Exeter, explained for TED Ed.
This particular virus seems to have originated from a fish and live-animal market in Wuhan, according to the World Health Organization. The coronavirus that caused the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, epidemic in China, originated in horseshoe bats before making its way to civets, small mammals that some people eat, which is how it became the first pandemic of the 21st century. The 2012 Middle East respiratory syndrome, or MERS, first jumped from camels to humans.
Zoonotic viruses are particularly dangerous because they’ ve got multiple species to infect and spread between, and are therefore harder to contain. Our risk of picking up these types of viruses has only gone up in modern times, as we continue to interact with animals and encroach further into their territory through activities like deforestation. Climate change hasn’ t helped, because warmer climates mean that certain pathogens can survive for longer in more parts of the world. And globalization means that we can introduce viruses to new parts of the world as we travel.
With quick action from public health officials, it’ s still possible to contain viruses. Hong Kong has already initiated a disease response plan, and airports in Shenzhen have started screening passengers for fevers and are doubling down on measures to stop illegal wildlife trading. Hopefully, these coordinated efforts will be enough to stop this coronavirus from reaching around the globe.",tech

660,"Coronavirus: CDC advises against nonessential travel to Wuhan, China","The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Thursday escalated its health warning to a level 3 as the coronavirus continues to spread, recommending that people avoid all nonessential travel to Wuhan, China.
The State Department reiterated its level 2 travel advisory, which urges people to exercise caution if traveling to an affected area.
An initial State Department website post erroneously showed that it had raised its travel advisory to a level 3, but the department later said in a statement to CNBC that it had made a mistake and that the travel advisory remains at a level 2.
`` Today, we updated the China Travel Advisory to include additional information on the outbreak. The Advisory remains a Level 2: Exercise Increased Caution, '' a State Department spokesperson told CNBC. `` Earlier today, the Travel.State.gov briefly displayed an inaccurate version of the Advisory due to a technical error – we apologize for any confusion. Again, the Advisory level has not changed. ''
The total number of coronavirus cases in China rose to 634 on Thursday as local authorities quarantined at least two major cities and canceled Lunar New Year's events in Beijing, China state television reported.
Chinese authorities have suspended air and train travel in Wuhan, which is under quarantine.
The virus — which was first diagnosed less than a month ago — has already killed at least 17 people in China and infected roughly 650 people around the world, including firsts in Singapore and Saudi Arabia, according to multiple reports from international and local media. Medical teams have been dispatched to affected cities, and hospitals are asking for donations of essential items including face masks, eye protectors, protective uniforms and sanitizer.
Local authorities in China have quarantined Wuhan and Huanggang, which have a combined population of 17 million, and planned a similar lockdown for Ezhou, a city of 1 million, on Friday. Travel bans were in effect for at least seven cities, including Wuhan, where the virus was first flagged to world health officials on Dec. 31.
China is offering to refund domestic airline and train tickets nationwide. An estimated 246,000 travelers arrived in Wuhan via either plane or train on Thursday before all transportation in and out of the city was shut down. The number of people who left the city is currently unknown.
U.S. health officials began screening passengers flying from China at major international airports over the weekend and confirmed the country's first case on Tuesday. A Washington state man is quarantined with the virus in a hospital outside of Seattle after flying back from Wuhan, U.S. health authorities said.
President Donald Trump on Wednesday told `` Squawk Box '' co-host Joe Kernen that `` we have it totally under control. ''
`` It's one person coming in from China. We have it under control. It's going to be just fine, '' Trump said in an interview from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.
Correction: The State Department issued the travel warning. An earlier story misidentified the agency that issued the warning.",business
292,Why Morgan Stanley’ s Earnings Report Matters,"On January 16, Morgan Stanley ( NYSE: MS) was the last of the “ big banks ” to report fourth-quarter earnings. In some ways, investors could say Wall Street saved the best for last. Morgan Stanley reported an impressive beat on both revenue and earnings.
In terms of revenue, the company posted $ 10.9 billion which beat analysts’ expectations for $ 9.8 billion. Morgan Stanley also posted $ 1.30 in fourth-quarter earnings, which was significantly greater than the consensus forecast for $ 1.02 per share.
Was this earnings report simply more of the same?
Analysts must have been excited to hear Gorman’ s announcement of a goal to increase the firm’ s tangible equity ( a measure of profitability) to a range of 13% to 15% by 2021. Gorman also says the company will seek to raise this metric as high as 17% in the future. Such a move would put the bank in rarified air. Only JPMorgan has hit that level among major U.S. banks.

NativeDisplayAdID=499 & ImpressionID=0 & UserID=0 & Placement=PlaceOnArticlePage '' > '); Eric Fry, one of America’ s top Investment Strategists, provides his latest report 5 Tech Stocks Set for 1,000% Gains after the Coronavirus Sell off. You can’ t afford to miss out on the once in a decade chance to buy after the recent 25% dip in the markets.
An additional line item in the company’ s earnings report was an 11% increase in its already large wealth management division. Morgan Stanley is synonymous with wealth management. However, in terms of the industry, it is considered more of a niche player.
That may be changing. Morgan Stanley is making this division part of its long-term strategy. This point was made abundantly clear on the conference call for the earnings report. Company management issued an improved two-year outlook for its wealth management division. The new projections are calling for the company’ s pretax margin to be in a range of 28-30%. This is greater than the 27.2 range the division had for all of 2019.
This is significant because the wealth management field is starting to get more crowded. In late 2019, Charles Schwab ( NYSE: SCHW) and TD Ameritrade ( NASDAQ: AMTD), among others, announced they would be moving to a commission-free trading structure. The rationale for these companies to kill these respective cash cows was that they would make up for the revenue loss, in part, by replacing trading commissions with advisory fees.
Compared to many of its peers, Morgan Stanley is undersized in fixed-income offerings and has declined to get involved in the trend towards passive exchange-traded funds ( ETFs) that try to mirror the market’ s performance rather than beat it.
Morgan Stanley has historically taken the view that when it comes to money management clients pay for expertise, not automation. That is a view that will be tested as the discount brokers attempt to enter the field. But it may play out well particularly if the markets begin to return to a more “ normal ” level of growth. 2019 was like fishing in a barrel for most investors. There is nothing like a market correction to test the mettle of less experienced investors.
To that end, Morgan Stanley is counting on the firm’ s $ 2.7 trillion in assets to carry it forward. The company rolled out a digital platform in the fourth quarter. While there’ s nothing particularly impressive about that ( digital is table stakes these days) it puts the company in the game. The firm will also attempt to leverage its $ 900 million acquisition, Solium, into the wealth management division. Solium manages the share compensation for 1 million employees at over 3,000 companies that include startups such as Stripe Inc. and Instacart Inc. These workers tend to be younger and do not necessarily have a banking relationship.
6 Stocks That May Not Survive the Coronavirus
Companies that are in a shaky financial position may sometimes attract investors in a bull market. Traders seeking a short-term profit can often use an oversold condition to capture a quick gain. But in a bear market, these companies frequently are left on the sidelines. But a declining stock price by itself should not be enough to scare investors off. What investors really need to pay attention to is the company’ s ability to finance existing debt or take on additional debt. Companies with low credit ratings face the problem of having too much debt on their books and an inability to finance it at more favorable rates. That’ s one reason we’ ve put together this presentation that highlights 6 companies that may not survive the coronavirus. These companies have low stock prices. In fact, many of them are, or will be, in danger of being delisted if they can not bring their stock above the $ 1 threshold. And on top of that, these companies each carry credit ratings of CCC+ or lower and are at risk of seeing those ratings even go lower. Each of the companies presented here are considered to be among the weakest, if not the weakest, in their sector. If you have any of these falling knives in your portfolio now is the time to cut your losses and walk away.

115,Tofurky launches new burger in crowded plant-based space,"Tofurky​ seems to be betting that its reputation as a legacy plant-based protein producer will help its latest innovation stand out on shelves despite increased competition.
The brand originally debuted its signature plant-based turkey replacement product back in 1995 and has more recently launched new products as the plant-based food and beverage segment has grown. This new plant-based burger comes after Tofurky recently accepted $ 7 million in private funding — the first debt position investment the private, family-owned business has ever taken on.
Despite its legacy reputation, it won't be easy for Tofurky to stand out in the crowded plant-based burger shelves. Other plant-based protein brands have dominated the space, including Impossible Foods, which started selling its burger in grocery stores last year, and Beyond Meat, which went public last year. But it's not just the plant-based giants. From Nestlé and Kellogg to Smithfield and Tyson, this trend has pushed big companies to launch more products in the space over the last year. Even grocery stores, like Costco and Kroger, are launching their own plant-based burger retail products.
Being a legacy veggie company in a market with new products that are gaining consumer attention is a difficult feat. Conagra's Gardein, Kellogg's MorningStar Farms and Kraft Heinz's Boca have moved aggressively to try to keep up their own portfolios as new products with a more meat-like texture and taste have come to market.
That seems to be the same case with Tofurky. The brand did previously launch a plant-based ground beef product, but it discontinued it to push out these new burgers, Forbes reported in October.
`` We had a DIY product, but we rushed to market with it, '' Athos told Forbes. `` You could shape it into a burger patty, but I think what happened with that one was we were never able to fully realize the quality we can get within our own kitchen. So, we scrapped that plan and pulled it from the market and started over. ''
Tofurky is also leaning into its sustainability efforts. Its patties will use recyclable cartons that offer 23% less paperboard material and inner packaging that has 69% less plastic film waste than others in the segment, according to the release. The company also claimed the burger's soy base is more sustainable compared to pea protein.
The new Tofurky​ burger will be made with soy, which is similar to the Impossible Burger and Kellogg's Incogmeato patty. Although using soy could make the taste and texture of the product more realistic, it could also face difficulty with consumers looking to avoid the ingredient, which is a top allergen. Pea protein has become an increasingly popular ingredient base in plant-based meat and for those looking to avoid soy. Beyond Meat's products use it, as well as Lightlife’ s Plant-Based Burger and Nestlé’ s Awesome Burger.
Plant-based foods are no longer just for vegans and vegetarians since consumers of all kinds are seeing them as an alternative to products like meat, milk, yogurt and cheese. Tofurky has seen that impact with its own sales, the company has sold more than 5 million holiday vegan roasts. As a result of increased interest, the company recently debuted a line of plant-based, dairy-free frozen cheesecakes and relaunched several flavors of frozen, plant-based Tofurky Pockets, which were discontinued in 2018. ​
Plant-based protein and meat alternative growth is projected to increase from $ 4.6 billion in 2018 to a massive $ 85 billion in 2030, according to investment firm UBS. Despite competition, that expected growth could push Tofurky and others to launch even more protein products in the space in the future.

560,Coronavirus: Heathrow to screen arrivals from affected Chinese region,"People arriving at Heathrow airport from the Chinese city at the centre of a coronavirus outbreak will be met by health teams including a doctor, the government has announced, as UK infectious disease experts doubled their estimate of the likely number of cases to 4,000.
Three direct flights a week arrive in the UK from Wuhan, where the outbreak began and which has been linked to a market selling seafood and wild animals. The type of coronavirus has never been identified before and it has been confirmed that human-to-human transmission is taking place. About 460 people have become ill and nine have died so far in China.
The World Health Organization will decide on Wednesday whether to sound the global alarm by classifying the disease as an outbreak of international concern.
Experts believe it is quite possible the disease, which causes coughing, fever and breathing problems, will arrive in the UK, as it has in the US. It can take at least five days for symptoms to show.
Prof Neil Ferguson’ s team at Imperial College, who carry out disease modelling for the WHO, said they had increased their estimate from 1,700 cases at the end of last week to 4,000. However, they say there is considerable uncertainty and the true number could be between 1,000 and 9,700.
“ You should not interpret that as the epidemic doubling in size in five days, ” Ferguson said. The increase was due to more information coming out of China, where doctors were struggling to deal with a rapidly evolving situation. “ All the reports I have read from within China [ suggest ] that hospitals are now overwhelmed with suspect cases. ”
The confirmed cases tend to be the more severe ones, in people who end up in hospital. But it is possible there are many more mild cases, which do not get reported but may lead to greater transmission from one person to another. “ It is vital we understand the rate of human-to-human transmission, ” he said. “ That will determine the feasibility of control and what measures will need to be taken. ”
Peter Horby, a professor of emerging infectious diseases and global health at the University of Oxford, said there was “ quite a long latency ” after infection before serious symptoms show, starting with a mild fever and a dry cough. “ After about a week or so, they develop shortness of breath and then severe respiratory distress. About 15 to 20% of hospitalised cases are severe, requiring oxygen or ventilation. ”
Experts say the spread of the coronavirus fulfils the criteria for the WHO to declare it of international concern. “ Personally, I think this is a big event, ” said Horby. “ Is it extraordinary? Yes, it pretty much is. We haven’ t seen this large-scale spread since Sars. ”
The death rate at the moment appears to be about 2%, which is far lower than in Mers ( Middle East respiratory syndrome) which kills about a third, or Sars ( severe acute respiratory syndrome) which had a death rate above 10%. Both are also coronaviruses. The big Sars outbreak began in China in 2002 but spread around the world and killed more than 800 people. Mers is far less transmissible.
Heathrow has put health screening in place before – notably during the huge west Africa Ebola outbreak, when all arrivals from the three affected countries, Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea, had their temperatures checked and filled out questionnaires about any possible exposure to the virus.
There will be warning messages during the direct flights from Wuhan, said the Department of Health and Social Care, and captains will be required to report on any passenger feeling unwell before takeoff.
Flights will arrive in an isolated area of Terminal 4, where they will be met by a port health team including a medical inspector and a doctor. All passengers will be asked about their health and checked for symptoms, including their temperature. They will be given instructions on what to do if they begin to feel ill once in the UK.
“ This is a new and rapidly evolving situation where information on cases and the virus is being gathered and assessed daily. Based on the available evidence, the current risk to the UK is considered low. We are working with the WHO and other international partners, have issued advice to the NHS and are keeping the situation under constant review, ” said Dr Nick Phin, the deputy director of the National Infection Service at Public Health England.
“ If you are traveling to Wuhan, you should maintain good hand, respiratory and personal hygiene and should avoid visiting animal and bird markets or people who are ill with respiratory symptoms. Individuals should seek medical attention if they develop respiratory symptoms within 14 days of visiting Wuhan, either in China or on their return to the UK. They should phone ahead before attending any health services and mention their recent travel to the city. ”
Public Health England has shifted its risk assessment slightly from “ very low ” to “ low ”, but, said the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, “ obviously we want to stay ahead of the issue so we are keeping a very close eye on it ”.
Most cases diagnosed have been in Wuhan but the virus has also spread to other Chinese cities, with a few cases in other countries including the US, Japan and South Korea.
Ahead of the lunar new year on Saturday 25 January, Chinese authorities have advised against travel into and out of Wuhan, adding that the country was at the “ most critical stage ” of prevention and control.
The UK Foreign Office has updated its advice for Britons travelling to China, warning the virus had spread to other areas outside Hubei province.",general
841,American Express Customers Continue to Pay for the Privilege,"
American Express ( NYSE: AXP) is continuing to build on its stellar 2019. Over the past 12 months, AMEX stock is up over 31%. In the first weeks of 2020, the stock is up almost 7%. The latest earnings report should do nothing to blunt the stock’ s momentum.
On January 24, the company delivered an earnings report that beat analysts’ expectations on the top line and bottom line. The company reported earnings of $ 2.03 per share which beat a Refinitiv forecast of $ 2.01 per share. Revenue was largely in-line with expectations posting a narrow beat of $ 11.365 billion as opposed to the $ 11.36 billion that was forecast.
Adjusted annual profit was up 12% from 2018 at $ 8.30 per share. Looking forward, the company is expecting profits to range between $ 8.85 and $ 9.25 per share. That is tightening the range that analysts polled by Refinitiv have which is for profit between $ 8.49 and $ 9.67 per share. American Express also forecast revenue to grow between 8% -10%.
That last piece of guidance is significant because despite their positive earnings in October, the company’ s stock took a brief tumble due to a cautious growth outlook.
The American Express name appears to retain its cache
The strength of the report was in AMEX’ s net card fees which exceeded estimates by $ 0.03 billion ( $ 1.08 billion vs. $ 1.05 billion). At 17% growth, card fees were the company’ s fastest-growing revenue item in 2019. On the conference call after the earnings report was released, AMEX management projected this trend would continue.
“ These results demonstrate the success of our strategy to generate sustainable, profitable growth across the enterprise over the long term, ” said AMEX CEO Stephen Squeri in a statement. The company added 11.5 million new proprietary cards in 2019. Nearly 70% of these new cardmembers chose the company’ s fee-based products.

Individual investors who aren’ t afraid of the risk are piling in and getting rich. You can try and figure out which companies to buy on your own…
The credit card industry has largely become a case of monkey see, monkey do. It’ s to the point where, for those with credit, the credit card products themselves are commodities. Each card is following a similar playbook to attract customers ( cashback on purchases, frequent flier miles, rewards programs, etc.). But investing in these incentives is a drain on capital. This creates a dynamic in which companies have to wonder if the juice is worth the squeeze. But not having such incentives would put them at a competitive disadvantage.
That’ s where American Express has stood out and continues to stand out. For many years, an American Express was only available as a commercial product. Businesses were content to pay the annual fee because “ membership had its privileges ”. And make no mistake about it, American Express has no plans to move away from their core consumer.
As more competitors like JPMorgan Chase ( NYSE: JPM) have aggressively moved in on the commercial turf, American Express has had to adapt. One way they have done so is to offer the card directly to consumers. This isn’ t new; American Express has been doing this for years. However, the latest earnings report indicates that consumers are still willing to pay that annual fee.
The future of AMEX will depend on how they adapt to digital
American Express has a history of exceeding analysts’ expectations. This report makes it 7 out of 8 quarters the company has delivered earnings that exceeded the consensus estimate. However, the largest threat to the company’ s growth is not really a slowdown in consumer spending, but an increase in consumer expectations regarding technology and in particular security.
“ There are tons of challenges facing card providers these days, ” says Cyndie Martini, chief executive officer at Member Access Processing, the largest aggregator of card services for credit unions in the U.S.
And, according to Martini, foremost among those challenges is the rise of digital payment technology. Fintech companies such as PayPal ( NASDAQ: PYPL) and Square ( NYSE: SQ) are crossing over into areas that are typically reserved for traditional banks. But they are also challenging credit card issuers like AMEX by forcing the companies to make a continual investment in innovative technologies which is a huge investment that ultimately eats into the profits of these companies.
Is AMEX a good buy right now?
American Express looks like a good buy for the foreseeable future. The challenges the company faces are not unique to AMEX. And the company is taking steps to migrate to a digital payment platform.
Plus, the company continues to require high standards for membership. This means that AMEX customers have a higher net worth than other card providers. This makes the stock a bit more recession-proof than others. And if those individuals continue to be willing to pay that annual fee, the company will enjoy a reliable revenue stream no matter which way the economy goes.


7 Gun Stocks to Buy During the Coronavirus Pandemic
Socially conscious investors may want to stop reading. But the fact is that gun stocks were some of the best-performing stocks at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. And they continue their positive momentum. Some of that may be historical. Firearms sales tend to increase during an election year. But of course, this has not started out as a normal election year. In March, the nation was gripped by pictures of long lines outside gun stores in several U.S. states. The website Ammo.com reported that bullet sales increased by 222% in the period from February 23 through March 15 as opposed to the first three weeks in February. And according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation’ s ( FBI) National Instant Criminal Background Check System ( NICS), there was a 73% year-over-year increase in background checks in February. “ The world has never seen anything like this and people want to make sure they're prepared for whatever lies ahead, whether that be food shortages, government shutdown, or worse, '' a spokesperson for Ammo.com said in an emailed statement. `` When everything around you is uncertain, having a supply of ammunition can make our customers feel safer. '' Given the likelihood of increased firearms sales, we’ ve created this presentation that highlights seven gun stocks that you should consider for your portfolio.

286,For Beyond Meat No News Can be Good News,"In one regard, Beyond Meat ( NASDAQ: BYND) has already won. The manufacturer of plant-based burgers and pork was one of the first to establish proof of concept. And as any failed startup can tell you, the victory does not always go to the company that’ s first through the door.
But the ride has been anything but smooth for BYND investors. When Beyond Meat issued its initial public offering ( IPO) in 2019, its stock quickly soared above $ 200. At that time, the stock looked destined to fail against the weight of expectations. And sure enough, as 2019 drew to a close, BYND had given back virtually all of its post-IPO gains.
Nevertheless, Beyond Meat has successfully moved past the awareness stage. Plant-based protein is gaining traction and is quickly becoming more of a trend than a fad. If you need evidence of this, just look at the increasing number of companies that are trying to enter the space. But it seems that every time there is news about Beyond Meat, good or bad, it has the effect of drawing attention to the limitations of the company.
When good news is bad news
A new year has brought new interest in BYND stock and Beyond Meat has risen to over $ 100 per share. One reason for the stock price increase is that the category is attracting attention from “ flexitarians ”. Flexitarians are neither vegetarian nor vegan. They are simply consumers who are making a conscious effort to reduce the amount of meat in their diet usually to help manage their personal health or based on their concern for the environment.
document.write ( ' < a style= '' text-decoration: none; font-weight: normal; color: # 696969; '' target= ''  blank '' rel= '' nofollow '' href= '' https: //www.ame ' + 'ricanconsumernews.net/scripts/click.aspx? NativeDisplayAdID=524 & ImpressionID=0 & UserID=0 & Placement=PlaceOnArticlePage '' > '); He helped save America from a $ 1.3 trillion banking crisis… I predicted the Great Recession of 2008… I predicted Trump’ s 2016 election… But now I’ m issuing my most urgent warning yet.
In fact, according to NPD Group, 18% of consumers are actively trying to eat more plant-based foods. That’ s the good news. The bad news is that these consumers have a plethora of options available to them. And not all of these restaurant chains serve the Beyond Meat brand of plant-based burger.
But the run-up in the company stock is being considered unsustainable. One reason is that Beyond Meat is still not profitable, at least not on a consistent basis. The company did post a profit in its last two quarters, but on a yearly basis, they have not yet recorded positive earnings.
Quint Tatro, chief investment officer at Joule Financial, said in the same “ Trading Nation ” interview that Beyond Meat is an interesting story, but not much more.
“ From a fundamental standpoint, it’ s very difficult for us to get behind this name. It’ s not profitable. Exceptional sales growth, but pure speculation, ” Tatro said. “ I’ m a fan of the company. I’ ve tried the burgers. I’ ve tried the sausages. I mean, it’ s great. But from a fundamental investment standpoint, they’ ve got to be profitable. They’ ve got to have positive cash flow. It’ s just going to take time. ”
Does the company have room to grow?
Another example where good news is not always good for Beyond Meat comes in its high profile contract with McDonald’ s ( NYSE: MCD). McDonald’ s recently announced that it would be expanding its test marketing of its plant-based burger ( the P.L.T.) to a larger amount of Canadian stores. Good news, right? Maybe and maybe not.
When its deal with McDonald’ s was first announced, skeptics cited the fact that McDonald’ s was not beholden to Beyond Meat as their sole provider of plant-based protein. So an expanded trial would not necessarily generate proportional sales growth. However, Impossible Brands, the company behind the Impossible Whopper, issued a statement that it does not have the capacity to service a market as large as McDonald’ s.
That’ s the good news. The bad news is that even expanding to 52 Canadian stores ( the original deal was for 28 stores exclusively in Ontario), is already factored into the BYND stock price. And according to Bernstein’ s Alexia Howard, the current stock price is even factoring in the potential for sales gains in a best-case scenario where McDonald’ s begins to sell the P.L.T. in the United States.
And this is leading some to question whether Beyond Meat has the resources itself to keep up with that kind of production. Analysts are suggesting that such a rollout would increase Beyond Meat’ s sales nearly three times by 2021. In fact, Howard has downgraded the stock from outperform to market perform as she says, reaching such a level of sales would “ likely test the high end of Beyond Meat’ s capacity ” based on the company’ s current expansion plans.
What can investors expect from Beyond Meat?
If the company can meet analysts’ expectations and stay on track to post positive yearly earnings, the stock may have room to go up from its current level. But the company is not expected to post positive earnings in the first quarter and so I believe it will take until the second half of the year to really see where BYND stock can go. For now, traders can trade BYND on the news. Investors may want to stay on the sidelines.

42,Kaepernick calls out US 'imperialism ',"Hi, what are you looking for?
By
Published
Colin Kaepernick, the former NFL quarterback whose kneeling protests of racial injustice roiled the league, called out US `` imperialism '' on Twitter on Saturday.
Kaepernick's tweets came a day after the killing of Iranian military commander Qasem Soleimani, although they did not specifically reference the Baghdad drone strike ordered by US President Donald Trump.
`` There is nothing new about American terrorist attacks against Black and Brown people for the expansion of American imperialism, '' Kaepernick tweeted.
`` America has always sanctioned and besieged Black and Brown bodies both at home and abroad, '' he added in a separate post. `` America militarism is the weapon wielded by American imperialism, to enforce its policing and plundering of the non white world. ''
The assassination of Soleimani has been followed by vows of reprisal from Iran -- met with a warning from Trump that the United States is targeting 52 sites in Iran if the Islamic republic attacks American personnel or bases.
Kaepernick, 32, was an NFL star in 2016 when he began kneeling during pre-game playings of the US national anthem to protest racial inequality -- demonstrations that Trump criticized.
He opted out of his San Francisco 49ers contract for free agency in 2017, but found no takers.
He reached a settlement with the NFL over claims that owners were improperly keeping him out of the league and had insisted in 2019 that he was `` ready to play '' despite almost three years out of the league.
His tweets came on the opening day of the NFL playoffs.

335,Nestlé to invest up to $ 2B in sustainable packaging,"As Big Food feels consumer pressure to go green and hustles to meet previously pledged sustainability goals, Nestlé is ramping up its efforts with a big investment.
Food and beverage companies trying to reduce their plastic dependence have faced difficulty finding suitable recycled material to replace it. Although more companies have made sustainability commitments, developing sustainable packaging that keeps products fresh, endures temperature shifts and remains affordable has not been an easy feat. Putting in up to $ 2 billion to make the shift away from plastics could help Nestlé lead the way when it comes to the development of more sustainable solutions.
Two years ago, Nestlé​ promised by 2025 it will make all of its packaging recyclable or reusable, and aims to reduce use of virgin plastic by a third. Nestlé's plan to pay a premium rate for the recycled material could alleviate any future shortages of used plastics for food packaging by tempting new suppliers to get into the business.
This large investment could be a result of pressure Nestlé has been feeling. A recent Greenpeace report found CPG companies haven't shown significant progress on sustainability goals. Nestlé was found to be one of the worst plastic polluters in North and South America. Although other companies were named in Greenpeace's report, Nestlé is showing it wants to get off this list.
Nestlé's total plastic packaging usage in 2018 was 1.7 million metric tons, according to the company's website. Globally, the company currently uses just 2% recycled plastic, though usage is a bit higher for PET water bottles, which have 5% recycled content. Nestlé Waters, the company's bottled water division, is the biggest in the world with brands including S.Pellegrino and Poland Spring, so there is a lot of room for progress.
Nestlé's new research initiative for start-ups could also prove to be a good forward-looking move. Many start-ups and smaller firms have been working on sustainable packaging solutions on a smaller scale, and an investment from Nestlé could give them the ability to scale.
The company is already working on packaging projects. Nestlé opened a research site near its global R & D headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland, to develop more sustainable solutions to packaging different food products. The company recently announced it would be offering its Yes snack bars in a recyclable paper wrapper. It also introduced paper packaging last year for its Nesquik flavored milk powder. And it's developing biodegradable water bottles and plans to use paper-based pouches for its Milo health drink.
Nestlé is not alone in these efforts. The Swiss company has been experimenting with water dispensers in an effort to shift to selling beverages without bottles, but so have PepsiCo and Danone. A number of other major food makers are also participating in recyclable packaging programs, including PepsiCo, Unilever, Mars, Coca-Cola, Mondelez and Danone. Additionally, packaging firms such as Tetra Pak have been working on more sustainable, paper-based options.
Sustainability is an increasingly important factor for companies as consumers and investors are looking for more brands to take the initiative on environmental issues. About 66% of consumers said they would pay more for products from brands committed to environmentally friendly practices, according to the Nielsen Global Corporate Sustainability Report. With the increasing demand for sustainable solutions, Nestlé​'s investment could be a good bet for the future.

321,"Fiji cyclone leaves two missing, 119 in emergency shelter","Hi, what are you looking for?
By
Published
A father and daughter were swept away in a swollen stream as Tropical Cyclone Tino caused widespread flooding in Fiji, forcing more than 100 people to take refuge in evacuation centres.
It is the second cyclone to hit the Pacific island nation in three weeks and the Meteorological Service has warned of `` destructive force winds '' with gusts up to 130 kilometres per hour ( 80 mph) and floods caused by heavy rain.
Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama on Friday told Fijians to `` stay safe, remain away from floodwaters '' as police searched for a schoolteacher and his daughter, believed to be aged nine or 10.
The pair were attempting to swim across a flooded river when they were caught in the strong currents.
The incident happened on Thursday before the storm developed into a tropical cyclone, but a police spokesman linked the tragedy to `` heavy rain brought about by the current weather system ( which) raised the river level ''.
On Fiji's outer islands, as locals were evacuated from their homes, many tourists fled beach resorts and made their way to the capital Suva before regional flights and inter-island ferry services were suspended.
Initial reports said damage was not extensive, but by Friday evening 119 people were housed in temporary shelters with National Disaster Management Office director Vaisiti Soko appealing for people to use the refuge serve and not take risks.
`` Please make the move as soon as you see the water begins to rise so that you and your family are safe, '' she said.
- 'Scary experience ' -
Nischal Prasad, who lost his home in northern Vanua Levu when Cyclone Sarai struck just after Christmas, told AFP he had no choice but to seek shelter.
`` Sarai destroyed my house and almost left my family homeless. My daughters had to hide under their bed from the strong winds. It was a scary experience, '' he said.
`` I haven't fully rebuilt my house yet and another cyclone is coming our way. I am very worried about my house, but I can not stay here when the cyclone hits. ''
Russian tourist Inna Kostromina, 35, said she had sought safety in Suva after being told her island resort was in the path of the cyclone.
`` We didn't want to get stuck in there and with the authorities warning of coastal flooding, anything can happen. So we decided to move to Suva for now. I think we will be much safer here. ''
While the Pacific islands are popular tourist destinations during the southern-hemisphere summer, it is also cyclone season.
Tropical Cyclone Sarai left two people dead and more than 2,500 needing emergency shelter as it damaged houses, crops and trees and cut electricity supplies.
On its present track, Tino would hit Tongatapu, the main island of neighbouring Tonga, on the weekend.
Two years ago, Tongatapu was hit by Cyclone Gina, with two people killed and nearly 200 houses destroyed.

607,WHO expert panel to decide whether new virus an emergency,"- A World Health Organisation panel of experts on the new coronavirus met on Wednesday to evaluate whether the outbreak, which has spread from China to several countries, constitutes an international emergency.
The 16 independent experts in disease control, virology, epidemiology and vaccine development held a closed-door meeting at the U.N. agency's Geneva headquarters.
Didier Houssin, an adviser to France's national health security agency, was seleted as chair. Chinese health authorities were to make a presentation by teleconference.
A news briefing is tentatively set for Wednesday at 1800 GMT.
Here are some facts about WHO Emergency Committees:
- Director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus announced on Monday that the WHO had called an Emergency Committee to assess the outbreak of the novel coronavirus ( 2019-nCoV) that began in the Chinese city of Wuhan at the end of last year.
- Declaration of a Public Health Emergency of International Concern - known as a `` PHEIC '' in WHO jargon - is rare.
- The WHO panel's recommendations, after assessing any evidence of human-to-human transmission and other factors, would have to be accepted by Tedros, who would declare an emergency.
- Only five emergencies have been declared in the past decade: the H1 virus that caused an influenza pandemic ( 2009), West Africa's Ebola outbreak, polio ( 2014), Zika virus ( 2016), and the ongoing Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( 2019).
- The WHO's criteria, laid out in the 2005 International Health Regulations, define a PHEIC as `` an extraordinary event which is determined to constitute a public health risk to other states through the international spread of disease and to potentially require a coordinated international response ''.
- Such situations are `` serious, sudden, unusual or unexpected '', carry cross-border implications and may require immediate international action, its rules say.
- A declaration would lead to boosting public health measures, funding and resources to prevent and reduce international spread.
- It could include recommendations on trade and travel, including airport screening of passengers, although the WHO generally aims to avoid disruptive trade restrictions. ( Reporting by Stephanie Nebehay; editing by Giles Elgood)",business
901,Coronavirus: from one food market to global panic,"In the final days of 2019, Xia Qingqing joined her parents for a late-night dinner just 200 metres away from the now-notorious South China seafood market, in the central Chinese city of Wuhan.
It has since been identified as the source of the new coronavirus that has infected more than 1,400 people worldwide, killed more than 40 and plunged China into chaos. Just as hundreds of millions of people should be reuniting with their families to celebrate the biggest holiday of the year, the lunar new year, swathes of the country have been put on lockdown and celebrations all but called off.
As Xia and her parents tucked into a special winter rice and egg porridge on 27 December, even city authorities may not have known that the virus had started spreading around the city.
It was not until three days later that they put out a public warning about a “ pneumonia of unknown cause ” which doctors had identified in Wuhan, and four days later that national authorities filed their first report about the outbreak with the World Health Organisation.
In early January, 36-year-old Xia started running a low fever. By then, authorities had closed the seafood market for disinfection, and identified 44 patients with the unknown pneumonia.
But when she went to a local hospital on 4 January for a check-up, no one asked Xia about possible links to the market, or mentioned the mystery new illness. Doctors told her to go home, rest and take over-the-counter medication.
She followed their advice but her condition continued to worsen. Her fever intensified, she started having respiratory problems, and eating or drinking became painful.
Her illness was developing in tandem with knowledge about the mysterious new outbreak. On 9 January, China announced it had identified a new coronavirus, from the same family that caused the 2002 Sars outbreak, in one of the Wuhan patients. Like all viruses in the corona family, it had originated in an animal; scientists were already racing to uncover the source.
The next day, authorities announced the first death from the disease and released the genetic sequence of the new virus online for study, winning plaudits for an approach that seemed very different from the official cover-up that exacerbated the Sars crisis.
There were even hopes that Beijing might have managed to stop the outbreak before it had really begun. On 13 January, Chinese authorities said they had not identified any new cases for over a week; and although a first case was reported outside the country in a traveller to China, she had first developed symptoms days earlier.
If the disease came only from eating some kind of infected animal, and the market where it had originated was shut, there was perhaps a real possibility that no further cases would appear.
But it has now emerged that even though China freely shared details of the cases it had identified in the early days of January, doctors on the ground in the city where the disease began were not testing widely for the new virus as the month progressed.
There is growing concern that a failure to carry out comprehensive testing during the early days of the outbreak could have helped the virus spread.
Xia believes she is one of many victims who do not show up in statistics; she was finally admitted to hospital on the day after the genetic code was released. Despite her link to the market at the centre of the outbreak, and symptoms that matched those of confirmed victims, she was never tested.
“ Before there were any testing kits, which was before 16 January, I was regarded as a highly suspected case, meaning that I showed almost all of the symptoms, ” Xia told the Observer.
But the hospital was already struggling with a sharp increase in patients showing symptoms that matched the reported coronavirus ones. Xia estimates that there were only two doctors on staff to check hundreds of people seeking help.
Terribly overstretched, they focused only on the most serious cases and so on 20 January doctors discharged Xia into the care of her parents, without even formally noting her link to the South China seafood market on medical notes.
That was the day China confirmed the disease could be spread between humans, rather than just picked up direct from an animal source.
The number of patients had tripled, cases had appeared in other major cities, including the capital Beijing, and in a sign of official concern, the country’ s authoritarian president, Xi Jinping, made his first comments on the virus, saying it must be “ resolutely contained ”.
Yet Xia was sent home, still sick, without having been tested. She is being cared for by her parents, but is terrified she might infect them; they try to protect themselves by staying five metres away from her at all times.
Three days later, China stunned its citizens and the world by putting Wuhan under quarantine. From the morning of 23 January, no trains, planes or public transport would be allowed to leave the city; roadblocks later stopped most private cars from leaving either.
Closing off a major industrial and commercial hub, home to 11 million people, was the bluntest possible admission that Beijing was now extremely worried about the new disease. Further decisive action included a pledge to build a new 1,000-bed hospital dedicated to the disease in under a week, and a second within two weeks.
Work has already started on the first, and given China’ s track record of throwing up a similar hospital in Beijing during the Sars crisis, there is little doubt that the prefabricated facility will be finished in this extraordinary timescale.
And in a sign that authorities had shifted from trying to downplay the disease, a very last-minute tribute to the doctors and nurses battling the disease was included in the new year television gala show, one of the most high-profile broadcasts of the year.
By the time lunar new year’ s day dawned, the government had gone even further. More than 50 million people were in lockdown across the country, and nearly every province in China had declared a “ level 1 ” health emergency, the most serious kind, which allows quarantines and other serious measures.
Yet all this may come too late to ward off a major public health crisis, infectious disease experts have warned. Yi Guan, a senior Hong Kong-based virologist who helped identify the cause of the Sars virus, said he was much more worried about this disease, and feared the window for controlling its spread might already have closed.
“ I’ ve never felt scared. This time I’ m scared, ” Yi, who heads the University of Hong Kong’ s state key laboratory of emerging infectious diseases, told China’ s influential Caixin magazine.
He visited Wuhan expecting to find the city on a “ war footing ” but instead was met with chaos and incompetence.
“ I don’ t think the local government has done what it should do, ” he said. “ They haven’ t even been handing out quarantine guides to people who were leaving. ”
The coronavirus could hardly have emerged at a worse time for Chinese authorities, appearing in the weeks before the lunar new year, China’ s most important holiday. It is usually the occasion for the biggest human migration on the planet – up to 3 billion trips – as people race home to celebrate with family, travelling on packed trains, buses and planes.
For the army of migrant workers from rural towns and villages who have powered decades of economic growth in China, it can be the only time in the year they get to return home and see their children and parents who have stayed behind.
Even as the scale of the crisis became apparent, millions whose travel plans did not take them near Wuhan packed their bags and set off for the annual reunion, although many journeys were longer than usual.
Evidence that patients may be able to carry the disease without any fever, cough or other common symptoms has added to concern. Tests have showed that a child in one family who did not appear unwell was in fact carrying the disease, the Lancet has reported.
But widespread apprehension has changed the nature of the celebration. Normally a time for parties and celebration, banquets and fireworks, instead across the country – even in places far from the centre or any reported cases – people were cancelling their party plans and staying home.
Streets, malls and restaurants were empty, attractions from the Great Wall to the Forbidden City and Shanghai’ s Disneyland had closed, and from Monday all group tourism – domestic and foreign – will be suspended.
Instead, many people stayed at home, and took to the internet to find out more about the crisis. From the early days of the outbreak, warnings were appearing on China’ s vibrant but censored social media. In early January, eight people were arrested for “ spreading hoaxes ” about what came to be known as the coronavirus, AFP reported.
Weeks later, vast numbers of people were turning to the internet for information about the crisis, as state media downplayed it and kept it off the front page of official papers, such as the People’ s Daily, and out of the main headlines on key television news programmes.
On Saturday, discussion about the disease on micro-blogging site Weibo had reached 8 billion views, according to the What’ s on Weibo website. “ It’ s very rare to see news topics get this big, ” site editor Manya Koetse said on Twitter.
By Saturday evening, China had confirmed it was dealing with a total of 1,372 confirmed cases, and a death toll of 41. Together with cases identified outside China – spread from Australia to the United States and France – more than 1,400 people have been infected. By comparison, during the main Sars epidemic, which lasted from late 2002 until July 2003, in total 8,098 people got sick, and 774 died.
Although most of the victims who have died from this new coronavirus have been older, and some have been in bad health, more people could be at risk if overwhelmed hospitals are not able to treat those with the disease. There is no cure or vaccine, but medical support can help patients’ own immune systems to fight the disease.
Xia – who is no longer feverish but has a bad cough, often producing blood – says she is comforted by the actions of the central government now in taking control.
“ At this point I think the focus should be on how, together, we’ re going to pull through, ” she said. But she thinks Wuhan officials will bear the brunt of scrutiny in coming weeks and months.
“ There can be no doubt they simply missed the best time for containing the outbreak, ” she said. “ The Wuhan government didn’ t offer timely and effective support to hospitals in terms of medical materials … they failed to raise awareness among the public. ”",general
461,Economic Slowdown in 2020? ETF Strategies to Help You,"Trade war worries may have subsided a bit to start 2020, but fears of a global economic slowdown have returned. In spite of a strong U.S. economy and robust stock markets, more than half of the chief executive officers ( CEOs) expect the global economic growth momentum to decelerate this year, per a survey done by PwC and released at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.
Among 1,600 CEOs across 83 countries, 53% sees a decline in economic growth in 2020. Just a year ago, 57% expected GDP growth to improve. The latest fear of slowdown also compounded with the International Monetary Fund ( IMF) downgrading its global growth forecasts despite the signing of a U.S.-China trade deal and less ambiguity over Brexit.
In the latest of a series of downgrades, the IMF now expects global growth of just 2.9% for 2019. This is lower than its previous 3% estimate, which itself was the lowest figure since the global financial crisis. IMF’ s latest prediction for 2020 growth is 3.3%, down from the previous prediction of 3.4%. The U.S. economy is expected to slide to 2% in 2020 from an expected 2.3% growth rate in 2019.
Global markets may remain wobbly in the coming days. Market participants will continue to evaluate the efficacy of the phase-one U.S.-Sino trade deal. Geopolitical tension in the Middle East is still alive. The latest outbreak of China’ s coronavirus could also be a drag on the broader market. MSCI Asia Pacific Index might feel a short-term adverse impact from this viral outbreak.
Trade tensions are not fully out of sight with the U.S.-China spat having chances of returning. Against this backdrop, below we highlight a few ETF strategies that can be beneficial in the coming days.
Dividend ETFs Could Be Saviors
Dividends or regular current income could save investors even if there is capital loss. So, one can bank on these high-momentum dividend ETFs like Reality Divcon Leaders Dividend ETF LEAD, Victory Dividend Accelerator ETF VSDA and Invesco International Dividend Achievers ETF PID.
The fund PID gives exposure to companies that have increased their aggregate annual regular cash dividend payments consistently for at least each of the last five consecutive years. It yields a solid 3.88% annually. VSDA looks to tap securities which are forecast to pay out higher dividends. LEAD invests in the largest U.S. companies that have the highest probability of increasing their dividends in the next 12 months ( read: 5 Dividend ETFs That Beat S & P 500 in 2019).
Bank on Quality
Quality ETFs are relatively safe and can help investors fight the looming economic slowdown. In this regard, funds like VanEck Vectors Morningstar International Moat ETF MOTI, FlexShares Quality Dividend Index Fund QDF, O'Shares FTSE Europe Quality Dividend ETF OEUR and Invesco S & P 500 Quality ETF SPHQ could be at investors’ disposal ( read: Play These ETFs on Visa-Plaid Deal).
Time to Bet on Emerging Markets
Investors should note that Emerging Market and Developing Economies are projected to have grown 3.7% in 2019, and are expected to expand 4.4% in 2020 and 4.6% in 2021, per IMF. Brazil’ s economy has seen one of the least slowdowns in 2019 ( expected growth is 1.2% from 1.3% in 2018). Brazil is expected to grow 2.2% in 2020 and 2.3% in 2021. This put iShares MSCI Brazil ETF EWZ in a sweet spot.
Investors can bet on emerging Europe ETFs like VanEck Vectors Russia ETF RSX. An oil price recovery is especially great for the oil-importing nation Russia. The Russian economy is expected to log 1.9% growth in 2020 from an expected 2019 growth rate of 1.1% ( read: ETFs to Gain & Lose From Higher Oil Price).
Europe Investing Could Be Gainful
Among advanced economies, Euro Area is expected to see an uptick in GDP in 2020 at 1.3% from a 2019 expected growth rate of 1.2%. A one-bp uptick in growth rate is also expected for the U.K. economy at 1.4% for 2020. Emerging and Developing Europe is expected to log a growth rate of 2.6% in 2020 from 1.8% in 2019.
The ECB remains dovish. The Brexit process could see an orderly ending. All these make Europe investing lucrative. SPDR EURO STOXX 50 ETF FEZ and First Trust IPOX Europe Equity Opportunities ETF FPXE are two good picks.

739,WHO says will decide on Thursday if China virus is a global health emergency,"The World Health Organization ( WHO) said it will decide on Thursday whether to declare a global emergency over the outbreak of a new flu-like virus spreading in and beyond China.
If it does so it will be only the sixth international public health emergency to be declared in the last decade.
“ The decision is one I take extremely seriously and one I am only prepared to make with appropriate consideration of all the evidence, ” WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.
“ This is an evolving and complex situation, ” he added. “ Our team in China is working with local experts and officials to investigate the outbreak. ”
He was speaking after the WHO held a day-long meeting of an independent panel of experts in Geneva on Wednesday.
Deaths from China’ s new coronavirus virus rose to 17 on Wednesday with more than 540 cases confirmed, increasing fears of contagion from an infection suspected to originate from illegally traded wildlife.
The WHO’ s head of emergencies program, Mike Ryan, said the priority now was to find the roots of how the virus is passing between people.
“ We are in agreement with Chinese authorities who have been clear and transparent that there is evidence of human-to-human transmission, ” he said. “ The primary issue is to limit ( that) human-to-human transmission. ”
The previously unknown coronavirus strain is believed to have emerged from an animal market in the central city of Wuhan, with cases now detected as far away as the United States.
Wuhan is closing its transport networks and advising citizens not to leave the city, state media reported on Thursday.

98,"Manufacturing, supply chain see greatest cost savings from AI: McKinsey","Manufacturing and supply chain management are complicated operations, which often leads to waste, according to Freightflows CEO Matt Morgan.
`` Any time that there's complexity, machine learning and AI can add significant benefit​, '' Morgan said in an interview with Supply Chain Dive.
The MAPI Foundation, a group that advocates for the manufacturing sector, says AI can optimize various stages of the supply chain from warehouse management to supplier relationships, according to a recent report.
One example is Procter & Gamble's use of AI and Internet of Things ( IoT) technology to automate warehouses and distribution centers. P & G was able to automate delivery of about 7,000 SKUs and cut supply chain costs by about $ 1 billion annually, the MAPI Foundation noted in its report.
Noha Tohamy, a distinguished vice president analyst at Gartner focused on supply chain analytics, said the findings of the McKinsey survey were in line with her experience.
The two main benefits of AI adoption are increased efficiency ( doing more with less or the same capacity) and decreased cost. The cost reduction is not typically the result of decreased headcount but rather improved forecasting. AI can provide better answers more quickly and `` can improve my market share or my ability to make products available, '' Tohamy explained.
The use of AI and IoT in the manufacturing setting is often referred to as `` Industry 4.0. '' Predictive maintenance is one area that could lead to efficiency gains, according to proponents of Industry 4.0. The ability for sensors to monitor machines and pass this data along to algorithms that determine if there's a problem can decrease downtime of equipment and thus increase output for any given factory. Improved uptime for machinery was the most common goal of predictive maintenance, according to to a survey from PwC.
But Morgan cautions that AI and machine learning are simply tools to reach a goal, not a goal themselves.
`` You need to start with a hypothesis, you start with a goal, '' Morgan said. `` And then you need to use the data to go find out how to improve that metric in the business. '' Modern technology has made it economical to apply machine learning techniques at a larger scale, but that doesn't mean they're the solution to every problem, he said.
Once the hypothesis is in place, data will be required to test it.
`` It doesn't have to be perfect data and it doesn't have to be massive and massive amounts of data, '' Tohamy said. `` But there's enough data for us to start training the AI model or the machine learning model. ''
Deploying a modern, industrial AI ecosystem is more than collecting some numbers and building a model. This environment requires analytics technology, big data technology, cloud infrastructure, domain knowledge and evidence, according to a 2018 paper in Manufacturing Letters by four researchers at the University of Cincinnati. This combined environment includes technology, but also the industry-specific knowledge needed to make AI a realistic tool.
As companies get this mix right, more will want to follow in their footsteps and the market for industrial AI is expected to expand 52% between 2017 and 2024, according to Research and Markets.
Just a few years ago, the examples of companies using AI and machine learning were few and far between, Tohamy said, adding that the outlook for AI in the supply chain space is `` extremely positive '' but said there was still work to be done to scale the technology across larger networks.
One of the challenges companies face is `` scaling up these use cases and those examples, '' Tohamy said. `` So, it's one thing to use AI for one specific product or one specific region, but how can I deploy that across an entire global, complex supply chain. These are the areas where I need more proof points. ''

Around 55% of the growth in exports in 2019 came from the Irish whiskey category, which now accounts for around half of drinks exports ( a total of €727m), according to the latest figures from Bord Bia, Ireland’ s food board.
The US is the key market for Irish beverage exports: accounting for 40% of exports in 2019 to a value of €676m ( $ 750m). Whiskey dominates exports to the US, with premium products driving growth.
However, Bord Bia warns that the trade war between the EU and US could result in further expansion of tariffs, which could affect Irish whiskey.
Tariffs are already challenging the Irish cream liqueur sector: dairy-related tariffs imposed by US authorities on EU products have impacted Irish cream liqueur exports.
“ Notwithstanding the issues of tariffs that now present a genuine impediment to growth for Ireland’ s cream liqueur sector in the US, America’ s strong performance and central role in the success of Irish beverages is likely to continue in 2020. Whiskey will continue to be the mainstay of that growth. ​
“ The development of new distilleries and whiskey offering in Ireland speaks to the general positivity in the sector, which can reasonably be said to have been transformed in the space of a decade. ​
“ However, the dependence for much of this growth on the US market brings its own risks, particularly in light of the potential for the sector to be inadvertently caught up in global trade disputes. ​
“ For Irish cream liqueur producers, the challenges currently presented by the North American market undoubtedly represent a setback. The industry will redouble its efforts to remain competitive and recalibrate its marketing strategy accordingly. Assistance for the cream liqueurs category will be a priority for Bord Bia’ s spirits strategy in 2020, which will commit to protecting existing business while developing new opportunities. ” ​
GIs and Brexit​
Gin has been a strong export performer for Ireland in recent years, albeit starting from a low base. Exports in 2019 rose 17% growth to €9m.
“ While the continued popularity of gin among UK consumers, and its central role in the pervading cocktail culture, means growth can be expected to continue through to 2020. The US is a market with growing possibility for some manufacturers. Although a niche offering in the Irish export context, it has a part to play in the overall diversity of the sector. ” ​
Although the UK is less important for Irish beverages than other export industries, Brexit remains a ‘ significant concern’ - particularly given the good performance of whiskey, cider and gin in 2019.
Leaving the EU will also mean removing participation in the EU’ s protected geographical indication designation scheme, which covers Irish whiskey among other beverages.
The US accounted for 40% of Irish drinks exports in 2019 to a value of €676m.
Irish exports to EU markets increased by 10% to €418m. Exports to France rose 45% to €86m; and exports to Germany also increased 20% to €84m; and exports to The Netherlands rose 51% to €34m ( although the country’ s role as a global trading hub means a substantial amount was for onward export).
Latvia remained an important market, although declined 13% in value to €48m.
Canada, an important market for cream liqueur and an increasing one for whiskey, saw a 2% increase in exports to €72m.",general
260,"China's new SARS-like coronavirus has spread to Japan, but we still know very little about it","
Fears are mounting across Asia over the cross-border spread of a
new coronavirus
identified in China that has killed one patient and sickened dozens, as health authorities race to identify the source of the pathogen.
The new strain of coronavirus, in the same family as the deadly severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome ( MERS), originated in Wuhan, the largest city in central China.
It was confirmed Thursday to have been detected in Japan, a few days after Thailand confirmed its first case of infection.
The outbreak has cast a shadow over Lunar New Year celebrations and
put the rest of Asia on alert
. Virologists around the world are now studying its genome sequence shared by Chinese researchers, but many questions still remain.
Researchers have yet to rule out the possibility that the virus could be transmitted from person to person, and on Wednesday, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a Watch Level 1 Alert -- the lowest of a three-tier travel health notices that warns visitors of Wuhan to `` be aware and practice usual precautions. ''
Two cases detected outside China

On Thursday, Japanese authorities confirmed that a man who had traveled to Wuhan was infected with the virus.
The man, in his 30s, lives in the coastal Kanagawa Prefecture just south of Tokyo. He developed a high fever on January 3 while in Wuhan, and returned three days later to Japan, where he was tested positive for the virus, according to the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare.
He has since recovered and was discharged from hospital on Wednesday, the ministry said. He said he had not visited the seafood market linked to the outbreak while in Wuhan.
The confirmation comes just days after Thai authorities said a Chinese tourist arriving from Wuhan had been quarantined with the new virus, the first time it had been detected outside China.
According to the World Health Organization, the 61-year-old woman also said she had not been to the seafood market in Wuhan. But she did report `` a history of visiting a local fresh market in Wuhan on a regular basis prior to the onset of illness '' on January 5, the WHO said in a statement.
The first, and the majority, of the infected cases in Wuhan have been traced to the Huanan Wholesale Seafood Market, which has been shut down for disinfection since January 1. Wuhan health authorities said on Wednesday that some `` environmental samples '' taken from the market tested positive for the virus.
Apart from fish, the market also sold other live animals, including birds, rabbits and snakes -- sparking concerns that the virus might have been transmitted to humans from animals, just like SARS and MERS.
The seafood market at the center of China's pneunomia outbreak has been closed down.
{ `` @ context '': `` http: //schema.org '', '' @ type '': `` ImageObject '', '' name '': `` The seafood market at the center of China & # 39; s pneunomia outbreak has been closed down. ``, '' description '': `` The seafood market at the center of China & # 39; s pneunomia outbreak has been closed down. ``, '' url '': `` //cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200114181046-wuhan-seafood-market-large-169.jpg '' }
Leo Poon, a virologist at the University of Hong Kong who was among the first to decode the SARS coronavirus, said the Thai case suggests two possibilities: the woman was either infected by an animal in another market, or by another person.
The first possibility would mean that the source of the new virus is more widespread than authorities previously believed, and the second would indicate its ability to transmit between humans -- which could turn a local outbreak into a global pandemic.
`` I think the first possibility is more likely, '' Poon said. `` This also reiterates the issue of food safety -- the risk of selling exotic animals in markets should be assessed now and new policy should be established as soon as possible. ''
China -- and the world -- has paid a heavy price for the consumption of wild animals. The SARS epidemic from November 2002 to July 2003
killed 774 people
after spreading to 37 countries. The coronavirus was traced to the civet cat, a wild animal considered a delicacy in parts of southern China, where the epidemic began.
But Professor Poon and other experts in Hong Kong said the possibility of human-to-human transmission can not be excluded.
Can it be transmitted between humans?
The question of transmission between humans is particularly crucial as China's busy Lunar New Year travel season has recently begun. Hundreds of millions of Chinese are expected to be crammed into trains, buses and planes for family reunions. Millions of Chinese are also expected to travel overseas around Lunar New Year, which falls on January 25.
Chinese health authorities and the WHO had long maintained that there is no `` obvious evidence '' of human-to-human transmission, and that no health care workers have been infected by the new coronavirus. But early on Friday, while maintaining the lack of clear evidence of such a transmission, Wuhan health authorities said in an announcement that `` the possibility of human to human transmission can not be excluded. ''
It reported a case where a couple were infected by the new coronavirus. The husband, who caught the illness first, worked at the Nanhua Wholesale Seafood Market, but the wife said she had no direct exposure to the market. A few other infected patients also denied they had any exposure to the market.
Migrant workers wait outside the Guangzhou train station before returning home because of the worry over SARS during the deadly epidemic in 2003.

To gain more understanding of the outbreak, a group of Hong Kong experts traveled to Wuhan this week to meet with Chinese authorities and visit the hospital where those infected were quarantined.
Chuang Shuk-kwan, head of the Communicable Disease department at Hong Kong's Centre for Health Protection, said that it is possible that the husband had transmitted the disease to his wife a few days after he was infected, and therefore human-to-human transmission can not be ruled out.
But the risk of sustained transmission between humans is low, given that no medical workers have been infected, Chuang said at a press conference on Wednesday.
Not as lethal as SARS
For now, the new coronavirus appears to not be as lethal or contagious as SARS or MERS. Its symptoms are mainly fever and coughing, with a number of patients having difficulty breathing.
A mysterious virus is making China ( and the rest of Asia) nervous. It's not SARS, so what is it?
As of Thursday, six patients remain in critical condition. Among them, some have renal and liver failures, and two are relying on life support, said Raymond Lai Wai-man, the chief infection control officer of the Hong Kong Hospital Authority, who is among the group that visited Wuhan.
Compared with 2003, when Chinese officials initially covered up the extent of the SARS outbreak, authorities in the country have been more open and timely in sharing information this time around.
Apart from inviting experts from Hong Kong and Taiwan to visit Wuhan, Chinese researchers have also shared the genome sequence of the new coronavirus with the WHO.
`` Additional investigation is needed to ascertain the presence of human-to-human transmission, modes of transmission, common source of exposure and the presence of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases that are undetected, '' the WHO said in the statement. `` It is critical to review all available information to fully understand the potential transmissibility among humans. ''

637,"Inside China's virus zone, unease grips a city in lockdown","BEIJING – In Wuhan, the central Chinese city that’ s ground zero of the deadly new virus spreading through the country, a sense of fear is rapidly taking hold.
On Thursday morning, the city’ s some 11 million residents woke to learn it’ s now on lockdown, with public transport halted, flights out canceled and trains not running right on the eve of the Lunar New Year holiday that traditionally unites families for days of feasting.
It’ s a dramatic escalation for Wuhan, which has found itself at the epicenter of a potentially global health crisis after a market selling freshly slaughtered meat and live animals was identified as the source of an outbreak that’ s killed over a dozen people and sickened hundreds.
Student Yi Zixuan is terrified a meal Sunday with friends near a hospital may have exposed her to the new coronavirus, which causes pneumonia in those infected.
“ I didn’ t wear a mask, ” said Yi, 21. “ I’ ve canceled a trip to Changsha during the Lunar New Year holiday and I’ m even canceling my plans to watch movies at the cinema. I’ ll try to stay home as much as I can. ”
With the death toll from the virus rising markedly last weekend, and more cases identified, life in Wuhan has gone from normal to fraught in a matter of days. Within hours of the travel restrictions being announced, hundreds of cars queued in barely moving traffic at a toll booth for a highway out of the city.
Home to a bustling port on the Yangtze River, Wuhan is a transport hub for central China with a number of high-speed rail lines converging there. A former British settlement, it still retains architecture from that period, with steel and car manufacturing among the main employers.
When Yi left home Monday morning, she says about 20 percent of people wore protective face masks; by evening, she estimated the number had soared to about 80 percent. Across the city, people are already finding ways to carry on — with caution. Yi’ s mother is still gathering with friends to play mahjong, but now they check each other’ s body temperatures before playing.
“ Our fate is at the mercy of the gods, ” Yi said. “ It’ s hard to tell who carries the virus so we have no other options. ”
For Wuhan native Guo Zirui, that means an unusual separation. One of the 21-year-old student’ s parents works at a local hospital so he says his family decided to send him back to his dormitory in Beijing, where he’ s studying at Tsinghua University.
“ The hospital is not a hotel so medical staff have to go back home after work, ” he said, speaking by mobile phone from Wuhan railway station on his way back to the capital on Wednesday afternoon. “ The situation is still unclear and we don’ t know if it’ s safe for me to keep staying in Wuhan. ”
The New Year holiday — when hundreds of millions of people are set to travel in the biggest annual migration of humans on the planet — is providing a significant challenge for Chinese authorities striving to contain the outbreak that has also infected people from Thailand to the U.S. On Wednesday, China announced a stepping up of controls at transport points across the country and increased screening of travelers. But officials admitted there’ s much they don’ t know about the new virus, which belongs to the same family of bugs as SARS, a respiratory outbreak that killed about 800 people 17 years ago.
The coronavirus symptoms include fever, cough or chest tightness, and difficulty breathing. While footage on social media showed deserted streets and vacant subway platforms in Wuhan, retiree Wang Ping, 61, said in an interview before the lockdown that people were still venturing out to shop and visit relatives.
“ I don’ t wear masks, because I’ m in great health condition, ” Wang said. “ For sure they will get it under control. ”",tech
459,Coronavirus: airports around the world carry out screenings,"Countries in Asia and elsewhere are checking the body temperatures of arriving airline passengers and adopting precautionary quarantine procedures in response to a new coronavirus that has sickened nearly 300 people in China.
China was blamed for making the 2003 Sars outbreak far worse by initially hiding information and blocking the work of the World Health Organization. This time, leader Xi Jinping has called for tough measures and said “ party committees, governments and relevant departments at all levels should put people’ s lives and health first. ” At the airport in Wuhan, the temperatures of departing passengers were checked and outbound tour groups were banned from leaving the city. Virtually everyone in a public role, from traffic police officers to bank tellers, is wearing a protective face mask.
One case of new virus has been detected in Japan. The prime minister, Shinzo Abe, has urged officials to step up quarantine checks at airports and other entry points and visitors arriving from Wuhan, China will be required to fill in health forms. Authorities have tracked down and are monitoring 41 people who had contact with one confirmed case. None of them have developed a fever, tight chest or other initial symptoms of the new virus.
Along with stepped-up surveillance, additional cleaning and disinfection measures have been ordered for planes and trains from Wuhan as well as for train stations and the airport. Authorities are ready for a worst-case scenario and are on extremely high alert.
As in much of mainland China, Hong Kong residents favour traditional markets where live poultry and other animals are sold. The government health department has advised people against visiting such markets or touching animals or their droppings.
Screening for the coronavirus has started at three airports for flights from Wuhan: New York’ s John F Kennedy; and San Francisco and Los Angeles international airports. The Center for Disease Control has developed a test to detect the new coronavirus and plans to share the tool with domestic and international partners.
It is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals.
The virus can cause pneumonia-like symptoms. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties.
In the UK, the National Heath Service has defined the symptoms as:
Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.
In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should stay at home for at least 7 days. If you live with other people, they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.
Yes. China’ s national health commission confirmed human-to-human transmission in January.
China’ s national health commission confirmed human-to-human transmission in January. As of 19 March, more than 219,000 people have been infected in more than 150 countries, according to the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering.
There have been over 8,900 deaths globally. Just over 3,200 of those deaths have occurred in mainland China. Many of those who have died had underlying health conditions, which the coronavirus complicated.
More than 84,000 people are recorded as having recovered from the coronavirus.
At Incheon airport near Seoul, the only airport in South Korea with direct flights from Wuhan, authorities have been operating two special gates for passengers from the city since 3 January where officials use ear thermometers to check passengers’ temperatures. Handrails of moving walkways and escalators, elevator buttons and doors, drinking fountains and other sensitive areas are also wiped with disinfectant twice a day.
Nigeria, China’ s top trading partner in Africa, has asked that travellers from Wuhan report to a medical facility if they feel ill and health authorities at points of entry are on alert for cases of coronavirus.
India announced on Tuesday that it will expand thermal screening of passengers arriving from China, including Hong Kong, to seven airports from the current three. In-flight announcements before arrival will direct passengers with a fever or cough who have traveled to Wuhan in the previous 14 days to declare themselves to health authorities. Thermal screening will begin in Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Cochin, and continue in Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkata.
Singapore will expand temperature screening at Changi airport, one of Asia’ s busiest travel hubs, for all travellers on flights arriving from China beginning on Wednesday. The health ministry said individuals with pneumonia and a history of travel to Wuhan within 14 days of the onset of symptoms will be isolated in a hospital as a precautionary measure and investigated. Malaysia has also beefed up screening at Kuala Lumpur international airport.
Civil aviation authorities have ordered airport managers to start screening incoming passengers from China, looking for fevers, coughs, breathing difficulties and sore throats.
Biosecurity staff and state health officials in New South Wales are meeting flights from Wuhan and are distributing pamphlets printed in English and Chinese to all passengers. The pamphlets describe symptoms of infection and ask people to identify themselves if they are experiencing any.
The Russian public health service has said it has developed a testing kit that would allow labs to detect the new coronavirus quickly. Russia is one of the three most popular tourist destinations for people from China, according to Russian officials.
Passengers making direct and indirect flights from Wuhan, China to Rome’ s Leonardo da Vinci airport will be checked for potential signs of the virus and people with suspected infections will be quarantined at an infectious disease hospital in Rome. Posters at the airport advise travellers to consider delaying trips to the Wuhan area and if they do go there to avoid touching animals or uncooked animal products.",general

86,Carlos Ghosn's wife says she wasn't in the loop about his escape,"Hi, what are you looking for?
By
Published
Former Nissan chief Carlos Ghosn's wife Carole said Tuesday she was not in the loop about his audacious escape from Japan, adding that it was the `` only choice possible. ''
Speaking after Japanese prosecutors issued an arrest warrant for her, Carole Ghosn told France's Le Parisien newspaper that she knew nothing about the December 29-30 escape when Carlos Ghosn jumped bail and fled from Tokyo.
The interview came hours before an eagerly awaited press conference by the disgraced executive in Beirut on Wednesday.
`` I wasn't aware of anything... I was in Beirut with my children to celebrate Christmas, someone called me to say ' I have a surprise for you. It was the best in all my life! '' she said.
`` Fleeing was the only possible choice as he saw his trial being postponed indefinitely and he was being detained in conditions that deprived him of his rights with the aim of dehumanising him.
`` Carlos can not plead guilty for things he did not do, '' Carole Ghosn said, adding that her husband was the `` victim of an industrial plot and the war between Renault and Nissan. ''
She said he was slightly tense before his press conference, adding that this was `` normal '' as he was making `` the most important statement of his life. ''
Ghosn had been facing trial in Japan on charges of financial misconduct, which he denies, before fleeing the country in late December for Lebanon, where he was reunited with his second wife Carole.
The globe-trotting former auto mogul accuses executives at Japanese automaker Nissan of manufacturing the allegations against him in a `` plot '' to prevent closer integration with alliance partner Renault.
Ghosn appears to have left his residence in Tokyo, which was monitored by surveillance cameras under his bail conditions, alone. He reportedly later met up with two US citizens and boarded a bullet train to Osaka on December 29.
In Osaka, he is reported to have been put into a large box with holes drilled into it to ensure he could breathe and then loaded onto a private jet that flew to Istanbul.
Airport security rules meant large items loaded onto private planes were exempt from screening -- a loophole that appears to have allowed Ghosn to escape unnoticed.
In Istanbul, he boarded a second private jet that took him to Lebanon, where he entered on a French passport.
Under his bail conditions, his French, Lebanese and Brazilian passports were confiscated and held by his lawyers.
But he was allowed to retain a second French passport -- in a locked case with the key held by his lawyers -- so he could prove his short-term visa status if needed when travelling in Japan -- which was allowed in the terms of his bail.

756,How lessons learned from SARS could apply to the coronavirus outbreak,"OSAKA – With the arrival of the Lunar New Year, Japan and other international destinations are bracing for an annual influx of tourists.
But as the deadly new coronavirus spreads from the site of its first detection in Wuhan, international concern is mounting that the world may face an epidemic similar to the 2002-2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS).
SARS killed 774 of the 8,098 people worldwide who got infected, according to the World Health Organization. Below are details of the responses taken at the time, and the lessons learned that are being applied to the current outbreak:
The existence of a new viral respiratory illness caused by what was labeled the SARS virus was first reported to the WHO in February 2003 by the Chinese government.
China said it had identified five deaths among 305 cases, mostly in Guangdong province, which borders Hong Kong. By the next month, the WHO had issued a global alert about a deadly unknown virus with respect to Hong Kong, and a travel advisory for Hong Kong, Singapore, Vietnam, and China.
Over the next few months, SARS cases would spread to 29 countries and regions, including the Philippines, Canada, Taiwan, India and the United States. Japan had several suspected SARS cases but no fatalities. The SARS virus appeared to have been contained by the summer of 2003.
The Japanese government ordered that visa applicants in China and Taiwan be interviewed and, if necessary, that the applicant present a doctor’ s certificate stating they were not infected with SARS.
Quarantine systems at airports were strengthened, including random temperature checks on all passengers, regardless of their point of departure. Similar measures were put into place at ports where cruise and cargo ships from China, Hong Kong and Taiwan docked.
Japan also sent medical teams to Vietnam and China to help stem the spread of the virus. According to the Foreign Ministry, medicine and medical equipment worth ¥387.8 million had been provided to China, Mongolia and other Southeast Asian countries by June 2003.
Experts say a big difference between 2003 and today is the Chinese government’ s attitude and rapid response.
China was slow to react to the danger 17 years ago and attempted to conceal it, even hiding cases from WHO inspectors. But the Chinese government subsequently upgraded its infectious disease facilities and reporting systems.
This time, the WHO has praised the Chinese response, with Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus telling media earlier this week that Beijing was quicker to identify the pathogen and share information about it, thus allowing South Korea, Japan, and Thailand to quickly diagnose their own cases.
For Japan, two major differences are that bilateral political and economic relations with China are deeper than they were in 2003, including a vast increase in the number of Chinese tourists here.
In 2003, according to figures from the Japan National Tourism Organization, there were about 449,000 visitors to Japan from mainland China.
That figure had increased to nearly 8.9 million in the first 11 months of last year, making a coordinated response and information sharing between the two countries particularly critical during a virus outbreak.",tech
442,Disney+'s ( DIS) European Invasion Steps Up Its Timetable,"Perhaps the biggest success story of streaming in the latter half of 2019 was Disney's ( NYSE: DIS) entrant into the field, Disney+. Riding a wave of content that had been largely unseen on streaming services, a range of new options, and one of the biggest meme properties ever thanks to Baby Yoda, Disney+ enjoyed spectacular word of mouth and a flood of new subscribers early on. There was some mention of churn taking place, however, and that may have been part of a recent word that says the European release of Disney+ is getting bumped up a week.
Advancing the Timetable and Locking Down Pricing
Originally, reports note, Disney+ was set to make its debut in portions of Europe March 31. Countries slated to get access on that date included Austria, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Spain, Switzerland, and the UK, so it looked like mainly the biggest economic powers of Europe would be let in first. Several smaller portions of Europe, like Portugal and much of Scandinavia, would be brought in in the summer.
The same reports also brought word confirming Disney+ pricing in Europe, which would vary based on country. The UK would be offered the service at 5.99 GBP per month, while it would be 6.99 in Euros everywhere else. The exchange rate as of this writing doesn't quite thread the needle, however, as 5.99 GBP converts to 7.05 Euros. Pricing for the year produces something of a bargain, though, as the prices stated previously are increased to just over tenfold for the year, at 59.99 GBP and 69.99 Euros.
document.write ( ' < a style= '' text-decoration: none; font-weight: normal; color: # 696969; '' target= ''  blank '' rel= '' nofollow '' href= '' https: //www.ame ' + 'ricanconsumernews.net/scripts/click.aspx? NativeDisplayAdID=524 & ImpressionID=0 & UserID=0 & Placement=PlaceOnArticlePage '' > '); He helped save America from a $ 1.3 trillion banking crisis… I predicted the Great Recession of 2008… I predicted Trump’ s 2016 election… But now I’ m issuing my most urgent warning yet.
A Shot Across Netflix's Bow
A quick comparison, meanwhile, reveals that Disney+'s pricing in Europe will be an exact match for Netflix's ( NASDAQ: NFLX) pricing in the region. This is somewhat unusual, given that in the US, Disney+ offers its streaming packages for a $ 2 monthly savings over its competitor.
Netflix is likely taking this news with a note of concern, as international subscribers have given Netflix much of its growth over the last few years. Reports suggest that international subscribers now account for 62% of Netflix's total subscriber base, which means Netflix will have to scramble to ensure those subscribers don't start jumping ship in rapid fashion.
Disney's Ramped-Up Timetable Means Trouble?
Now, of course, we're left to consider just why Disney+ is stepping up the European launch. A report from Tubefilterabout two weeks ago suggested that Disney+ was already starting to hit the “ churn zone ”, along with Apple TV. For those not familiar, the “ churn zone ” is basically just a generalized term that means that streaming customers have seen what they came to see and are now canceling subscriptions because the value is no longer there. The exact numbers on this churn haven't been revealed, and any attempt to project is little more than a guess, beyond saying “ there's some. ”
This is a problem that some have already posited would come into play. With a growing number of streaming services out there, there's not a whole lot of point in customer loyalty. Take out a subscription, watch what you want to watch, then cancel the service to go grazing in some other field for a while. There are certainly plenty out there, both established veterans and newcomers alike.
Theoretically, a customer willing to go through a lot of signups and cancellations, and subsequent restarts, could comfortably graze new shows dry, and go elsewhere until that field could green back up with fresh seasons of favored shows. We 've already seen people doing this with Netflix and “ Stranger Things, ” departing the service until a new season returned.
Disney already made one potential streaming blunder, reports note; it's packed a whole lot of goodies into 2019, so that the early days of Disney+ would be packed with available titles. When those titles are consumed, reasons to stick around decline, and the migratory grazing can begin. But that's going to hurt Disney+ going forward, as it loses out on all that subscriber revenue until it can regrow new content, a development which Hollywood Reporter notes likely won't happen for a large part of 2020.
Hence, a possible reason for the accelerated timetable. Disney+ may well have seen that it's going to need a fresh slug of income to keep its service looking viable, and so it turned to a fresh launch to keep that up. With at least one more launch to follow in summer, it might be able to hold the line through 2020 even with churn in full play. Only time will tell if Disney+ will be just another grazing stop or a field where customers set up camp for good.
6 Stocks That Will Benefit From a Dovish Federal Reserve
The quaint correction that was labeled the “ tech wreck ” of 2018 seems like a distant memory to investors. What also seems like a distant memory is any thought of the Federal Reserve raising interest rates. At the end of 2018, the Federal Reserve had raised its benchmark federal funds rate. With the trade dispute with China dragging on, there was increasing pressure on the Fed to lower interest rates. When interest rates are lower, stocks will generally rise as investors have no other option for growth. In July 2019, the doves got their wish. But in a move that now seems to be a “ what did they know move ”, the Fed dropped rates again in October. The market soared to record highs in January and early February. Since mid-February however, the market has fallen dramatically, and the Fed juiced the market one more time by cutting rates down to levels not seen since the financial crisis. None of us know for sure when the U.S. economy will be opened up. And while stocks are still a good investment, not every stock is a smart investment at this time. But some stocks perform well when interest rates are falling and that’ s why we’ ve prepared this presentation. These six stocks stand to benefit from both low-interest rates and the unique economic conditions being brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic.

256,Krave embraces plant-based craze with new jerky product,"Krave has introduced two varieties of plant-based jerky and two flavors of pork rinds. The Texas-based protein snacks maker, owned by Hershey, said the new products will be available on store shelves and online this month.
The plant-based jerky — the brand's first meatless product — contains peas and fava beans and provides 8 grams of protein per serving. It comes in Smoked Chipotle and Korean BBQ flavors, Krave said in a release. The pork rinds are made with hormone-free pork and are available in Chili Lime and Al Pastor Taco varieties.
Jimmy McClain, Krave's brand manager, said in the release that consumers are looking for additional plant-based products for more snacking opportunities. They also are adopting specialized diets such as keto and paleo, he noted, and these new products offer more portable snacks tailored to them. `` With the growing number of snacking occasions and evolving nutritional expectations placed on those snacks consumers are dramatically altering the way we think about innovation, '' McClain said.
This is Krave's first foray into plant-based jerky, and the company is hoping the new item will appeal to flexitarians and those who want more plant-based foods in their diet. That hope also fueled the debut last fall of Kellogg's Leaf Jerky, a soy-based snack containing 80 calories and 11 grams of protein per serving.
Other plant-based jerky products featuring sun-dried tomatoes, eggplant, apples and even pineapple have been appearing on store shelves — all marketing themselves as healthier, non-GMO and vegan alternatives to traditional beef jerky.
Krave seems to be taking a different tack by offering both plant-based and meat-based snacks, although the company comes from a foundation in gourmet meat and poultry products. While it sources peas and fava beans for its new jerky, Krave is aiming for a taste and texture similar to its meat items by using the same proprietary production process.
This positioning fits well with the current direction of Hershey, which has been aggressively expanding into snacks outside of its core candy business through M & A. Most recently, it purchased protein bar maker One Brands for $ 397 million. After the Pennsylvania-based CPG maker acquired Krave in 2015 for about $ 220 million, the jerky manufacturer began innovating with better-for-you snacks containing protein, dried fruit and quinoa and also a stick with protein, sweet potatoes or whole beans.
It's likely the market will see even more of these plant-based jerky snacks due to the overall push away from conventional animal-sourced products. According to SPINS data commissioned by The Good Food Institute, the U.S. market for plant-based jerky hit $ 3.9 million for the year ending April 2019.
While plant-based options are growing in popularity, conventional jerky products are not going away anytime soon. Meat snacks are one of the fastest-growing categories in snack foods today because of their high protein content and intriguing flavors — while at the same time providing a quick energy hit for the on-the-go snacker. Sales of jerky topped $ 1 billion in 2017, and the market is expected to grow 4.2% on an annualized basis through 2022, according to Project NOSH.
Krave's pork rind product could draw a different type of consumer than the plant-based jerky due to its meat-based status. They are more likely to appeal to consumers looking for crunchy snacks without carbs and those who may be flexitarian in their dietary choices.
Since Krave is pitching the pork rind as hormone-free and made from all-natural pork, that combination could dovetail with what The Wall Street Journal last year called a `` golden age '' of gourmet pork rinds made with premium ingredients such as humanely raised pork and Himalayan pink salt. This debut, along with the plant-based jerky, shows Hershey is cognizant of the trends impacting the broader food space and how it needs to expand Krave's offerings to address more consumer preferences.
With its products in public school cafeterias and a teen-focused website that connects animal agriculture to global warming, the company aims to feed and educate the next generation.

802,Dollar dips vs yen as investors reach for safe havens on virus scare,"The U.S. dollar slipped against the safe-haven Japanese yen on Friday as investors fretted over concerns that a spreading virus from China would curb travel and hurt economic demand.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC) on Friday confirmed a second U.S. case of the new coronavirus from China in a Chicago woman, and said as many as 63 potential cases were being investigated as the sometimes-deadly illness continues to spread around the globe.
The newly discovered virus has killed 26 people and infected more than 800. Most of the cases and all of the deaths so far have been in China, where officials have imposed severe restrictions on travel and public gatherings.
Against the yen, which tends to draw investors during times of geopolitical or financial stress given Japan's status as the world's largest creditor, the dollar was 0.22% lower at 109.24 yen.
`` The dollar and yen rallied modestly in New York trade on Friday, with safe-haven buying the main driver into the weekend, '' Ronald Simpson, managing director, global currency analysis at Action Economics, said in a note.
`` Nerves were ramped up some as the coronavirus outbreak appeared to have worsened, '' Simpson said.
The dollar's appeal as a safe haven helped boost it near an eight-week high against the euro on Friday. The move was aided by lukewarm European PMI data that added to the broader market conviction that European central bank policymakers will maintain a loose monetary policy for the near future.
Euro zone business activity remained lackluster with the IHS Markit's Euro Zone Composite Flash Purchasing Managers ' Index ( PMI), seen as a good gauge of economic health, holding at 50.9 in January but missing the median prediction in a Reuters poll for 51.2.
That followed an earlier PMI from Germany, Europe's largest economy, which showed the private sector gained momentum.
The euro was 0.23% lower against the greenback at $ 1.1027.
The survey data comes a day after the European Central Bank did not make any policy change, standing by its pledge to keep buying bonds and, if needed, cut interest rates until euro zone inflation headed back to its goal.
Sterling retreated on Friday, after initially strengthening, as some investors still expected an interest rate cut next week even though business surveys pointed to a post-election bounce in Britain's economy. The pound was 0.33% lower against the greenback.
The Canadian dollar fell about 0.13% against its U.S. counterpart as the coronavirus outbreak weighed on oil prices.",business

With the intention of being the nation’ s first midstream energy-agriculture company, a privately held Wyoming company on Monday obtained permits to use produced water from oil and natural gas operations on the state’ s agricultural lands.

Encore Green Environmental ( EGE) officials said exploration and production ( E & P) companies are taking a “ show me ” attitude about whether produced water can prove valuable to the agricultural sector and cut wellsite costs.

EGE’ s first project is on private land near Pine Bluff in the southeast corner of the state and is using proprietary “ conservation by design ” methods and best available water purification technology.

“ From the E & Ps’ perspective, we’ re just disposing of the water, but by re-purposing the water we’ re putting it to use to grow vegetation and improve arid soils, ” said general manager Jeff Holder.

Former Petroleum Association of Wyoming executive John Robitaille recently became EGE’ s president in charge of Wyoming operations. He said the state Department of Environmental Quality ( DEQ) is taking a leadership position to transform produced water into a useful product.

“ Our business model is set up to produce operator savings, ” Robitaille said. “ As we are supporting agriculture and industry, we believe we can create value in the produced water, while cutting costs for the operator, and thus, keeping the wells operating for a longer period of time. ”

Robitaille said EGE’ s business model is a chance for the state to be the first to unleash value in produced water.

Water purifying equipment can be moved “ onsite very quickly as it is trailer-mounted; we do not own any of the equipment nor do we want to due to the ever-changing technology. We prefer to use the best technology for the specific job, so we use vendors to treat the water for us. ”

EGE also is looking at prospects in New Mexico, Texas and Oklahoma. Following legislation in New Mexico last year, a collaborative is looking at produced water, and EGE is part of the state-led effort.

Under New Mexico House Bill 546, the Oil Conservation Division has the primary regulatory authority for oil and gas protections, including “ clarifying and improving ” produced water regulations in the state.

398,World's 22 richest men have more than all women in Africa: Oxfam,"Hi, what are you looking for?
By
Published
The number of billionaires has doubled in the past decade and the world's 22 richest men now have more wealth than all the women in Africa, Oxfam said Monday in an appeal to the Davos elite to get serious about inequality.
`` Our broken economies are lining the pockets of billionaires and big business at the expense of ordinary men and women. No wonder people are starting to question whether billionaires should even exist, '' Oxfam's India head Amitabh Behar said.
`` Women and girls are among those who benefit least from today's economic system, '' Behar said ahead of the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, where he will represent Oxfam.
There will be at least 119 billionaires worth about $ 500 billion attending Davos this year, Bloomberg reported, with the highest contingents coming from the United States, India and Russia.
`` The very top of the economic pyramid sees trillions of dollars of wealth in the hands of a very small group of people, predominantly men, '' the Oxfam report said.
`` Their wealth is already extreme, and our broken economy concentrates more and more wealth into these few hands, '' it said.
The report said women and girls put in 12.5 billion hours of unpaid care work each and every day, estimated to be worth at least $ 10.8 trillion a year.
Oxfam's annual report on global inequality is traditionally released just before the forum opens on Tuesday in the Swiss Alpine resort.
- Startling stats -
It had some astonishing statistics.
If the world's richest one percent paid just 0.5 percent extra tax on their wealth for 10 years, it would equal the investment needed to create 117 million new jobs in elderly and child care, education and health, Oxfam said.
Oxfam's figures are based on data from Forbes magazine and Swiss bank Credit Suisse, but they are disputed by some economists.
The numbers show that 2,153 billionaires now have more wealth than the 4.6 billion poorest people on the planet.
Women and girls are burdened in particular because they are most often care givers that keep `` the wheels of our economies, businesses and societies moving, '' Behar said.
They `` often have little time to get an education, earn a decent living or have a say in how our societies are run, '' and `` are therefore trapped at the bottom of the economy, '' he added.
`` Across the globe, 42 percent of women can not get jobs because they are responsible for all the caregiving, compared to just six percent of men, '' Oxfam figures showed.
The report called on world governments to `` build a human economy that is feminist and values what truly matters to society, rather than fuelling an endless pursuit of profit and wealth ''.

With a population of around 11 million, Wuhan is one of China’ s major transport hubs for flights, trains and ferries.
Wuhan Tianhe International Airport is situated 26km north of Wuhan City and operates direct flights to New York, London, San Francisco, Paris, Rome and Moscow.
The Washington Post stated that the city’ s railway station has been fortified with armed guards to ensure that no person leaves the city.
Passengers driving out of Wuhan were checked for temperature by health workers in hazmat suits.
Coronavirus has been identified in other countries as well, with four cases in Thailand and one case each in the US, Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan.
It is estimated that this move will impact the plans of around 400 million people who plan to travel to other parts of the country by air, rail transport or road for the Lunar New Year holiday, starting on Friday.",general

684,The Hottest Energy Conflict Right Now,"Belarus has just bought two cargoes of Johan Sverdrup, the recently commissioned Norwegian oilfield and is in talks with several oil-producing countries from the Soviet Union to ramp up crude imports in the upcoming weeks. This in and of itself might not seem such a big thing yet considering that Belarus in the past years was 100 percent reliant on Russian crude and has barely purchased any in 2020, it marks an unexpected escalation of what initially seemed to a technical issue, a transit fee discrepancy, that should have been sorted on a professional level, without the involvement of politics. Instead, the undeclared war between Belarus and Russia is now upending traditional lines of supply and wreaking havoc in the two states. Let & rsquo; s start with the chronology first. The roots of the conflict are to be traced back to the inability of the two sides to settle on a crude supply deal for 2020, one which would build on the previous years & rsquo; uninterrupted supplies whereby Belarus was buying 23-24 million tons per year, of this some 18 million tons per year for domestic usage in its 240kbpd Novopolotsk and 320kbpd Mozyr Refineries. Belarus rejects any Russian proposals that mirror the pricing practice of the past years as the Russian tax maneuver jeopardizes up to 5 percent of Belarus & rsquo; GDP. The Russian tax maneuver is a long-mooted step to phase out crude and product export duties and offsetting the balance by means of a Mineral Resources Extraction Tax MRET increase. Graph 1. Russian Export Duty in 2014-2020, USD per metric ton. Source author. Since Belarus has been receiving all crude oil duty-free up until the last days of 2019, Russia & rsquo; s decision to move in the direction of harmonizing its oil sector taxation with the requirements of its post-CIS integration brainchild, the Eurasian Economic Union, renders it inadvertently one of its victims. The phasing out is not immediate as it is spread out over five years 2019-2024 yet Belarus does not want to sit idly whilst the margins and profits of its refiners shrink and their standing vis- & agrave; -vis Russia becomes unfavored. To complicate matters even more, 6mtpa of the 24mtpa Belarus annually purchased were only nominally related to the Eastern European state & ndash; the Kremlin used it as a political sweetener for purely political reasons, these volumes were customs cleared in Belarus not Russia so that the Belarussian budget gets some $ 600-800 million per year. Related Expect A Strong Year For Oil DiscoveriesSource CEFO. This might seem as a tough nut to crack & ndash; thanks to the duty-free character of crude imports Belarus saved approximately $ 2 billion per year and now would be compelled to purchase crude at market level. However, the particularities of post-Soviet deal-making render it even more complicated. All of the crude agreements are inextricably linked to the two sides & rsquo; gas agreements Belarus has paid 132 USD/MCm whilst the average European price of Gazprom was 242 USD/MCm in 2018 and 202 USD/MCm in 2019, Minsk & rsquo; s manifold debt repayment schemes vis- & agrave; -vis Russian state banks and President Lukashenka & rsquo; s erratic foreign policy. Gas negotiations are palpably less toxic than the crude-related ones, owing in no small part to the fact that Gazprom controls Belarus & rsquo; gas transmission network, i.e. it can not be used as a bargaining chip in bilateral negotiations/disputes. This is not the case with crude and one can see the result & ndash; as soon as the Belarussian-Russian dispute emerged, the Belarussian Trade and Anti-Monopoly Ministry declared that it seeks an immediate 16.6 percent hike on pipeline crude transit volumes the crude which is supplied to Central and Eastern Europe via the Druzhba pipeline. The Belarussian President upped the ante by imposing a sudden 50-percent & ldquo; environmental tax & rdquo; on all crude and product transit volumes, needless to say that in a completely unannounced fashion. Related Goldman China Coronavirus Could Push Oil Down By $ 3 Why Johan Sverdrup The reason for buying Johan Sverdrup is fairly straightforward & ndash; the 28 degree API density grade is very similar in its product yield to Urals, the crude for which both Belarussian refineries were initially configured. According to market rumors, the Belarussian state company BNK bought two Aframax cargoes and will ship them home from the Lithuanian port of Klaipeda, delivering them to the Novopolotsk Refinery by rail. The vicinity of Norway & rsquo; s continental shelf played no small part in this & ndash; MT Breiviken which will deliver the first cargo loaded January 19 and by January 23 it had already reached its final destination, i.e. the required voyage was really quick, coming in handy for Minsk & rsquo; s bargaining position even if it overpaid it. What does Russia seek As much as Russia has garnered a rather adverse reputation for its energy sector-related dealings, with Belarus it faces a difficult dilemma & ndash; it wants to make sure that a powerful political message is made to President Lukashenka, all the while keeping Belarus & rsquo; oil sector out of the trouble. Its interests are by no means altruistic & ndash; Belarus & rsquo; largest refinery in Mozyr is co-owned by a joint venture of Rosneft and Gazprom Neft, meaning that Russian NOCs control 42.58 percent of the asset the rest is controlled by the Belarussian state. Given that Belarus & rsquo; downstream was loss-making even in the & ldquo; good & rdquo; years of 2017 and 2018, primarily due to government-controlled fuel prices and currency devaluations, neither of the companies wants to incur even deeper losses. What next As wild as the current situation seems, this is not the first time such unbridled negotiations take place. Tariff hikes are a usual subject for the two sides & rsquo; disputes, moreover in 2010 Belarus has already tried to import Venezuelan crude to demonstrate that it can survive without Russian deliveries. Lukashenka & rsquo; s cash-strapped regime needs further Russian loans and Moscow & rsquo; s cooperativeness in keeping Belarus & rsquo; loss-making energy sector afloat, all the while Russia, seeking to enter a new period of d & eacute; tente with Europe, has no political interest in spoiling its geopolitical game by actions in Belarus. Hence, after the bombastic declarations and threats abate, Moscow and Minsk will curve out yet another modus operandi which everyone knows will last only for a couple of years, only to repeat the entire process from scratch.

510,Tyson Foods starts coalition to tackle sustainable protein,"As consumers consider which products to buy at the grocery store, their decisions are increasingly influenced by issues that go beyond just the food or beverage product. Shoppers are giving greater weight to the role businesses play in tackling global problems such as the environment, traceability, transparency and sustainability.
Nielsen found that a company’ s commitment to sustainability can sway product purchases for 45% of consumers. For companies that don't take these steps, they potentially risk losing millions of dollars in sales to their competitors who do. In recent years, businesses including Mars, PepsiCo, Coca-Cola, Unilever and Walmart have announced some type of pledge — most often focusing on where their products come from, who produces them, how they are manufactured and their impact on the environment.
But with nearly all food and beverage companies accounting for some type of sustainability effort, there has been criticism from some environmental groups as to how much impact it's having on the underlying cause and if businesses are actually following through on those pledges. A 2019 report from Greenpeace said none of the companies that pledged to reduce deforestation in their supply chain, for example, had been successful yet.
In forming a coalition, Tyson is trying to expedite the role it plays in tackling issues such as food waste, hunger and conservation while at the same time acknowledging it can't do it alone. For the pork, chicken and beef processing giant to have a meaningful impact, Tyson is saying that it needs to have input from entities beyond corporate America. The Coalition for Global Protein is tapping into academics, non-govermental organizations, financial institutions and other protein makers for their own expertise and opinions that may be far different than what the Arkansas-based Tyson could bring to the table on its own.
“ We’ re focused on uniting the world’ s most influential, food-focused stakeholders around a shared purpose to build a future of protein that is sustainable and equitable across global communities — at every link in the supply chain, ” John Tyson, chief sustainability officer of Tyson Foods, said in a statement. “ Igniting transformative change in our food system requires industry-wide collaboration and a willingness to go beyond our individual businesses through strong commitments and actions. ”
After several years where individual food and beverage companies announced their own initiatives, there is early evidence that at least a few groups are finding that it helps to look beyond their own walls.
The board of the North American Meat Institute, which represents 95% of red meat processors and 70% of turkey products, ​ unanimously agreed in July to encourage companies to share sustainability best practices. Prior efforts focusing on collaboration in worker safety, food safety and animal welfare yielded improvements in each of those categories. And in October soda rivals Coca-Cola, Keurig Dr Pepper and PepsiCo partnered with the World Wildlife Fund, the Recycling Partnership and Closed Loop Partners to recycle more and reduce the industry's use of new plastic.
To be sure, partnerships like the Coalition for Global Protein doesn't preclude companies from moving forward with their own initiatives. Tyson noted prior commitments it has made to improve land stewardship practices on two million acres of corn, partnering with the World Resources Institute to set science-based greenhouse gas reduction targets, reducing water use intensity by 12% and working with Proforest to identify deforestation risks across the company’ s global supply chain.
In the end, it will likely take a combination of joint partnerships and individual efforts for companies to have an impact on sustainability that moves the needle. While consumers are interested in which companies are partaking in sustainability, it's not always enough. People want to see results, and coalitions like this one could be the best way to do that.

709,Wuhan coronavirus'super spreader ' alarms disease detectives,"That's what's called a `` super spreader, '' and disease detectives are hot on that patient's trail. It's one element to stopping the spread of this coronavirus that's killed 17 people and infected more than 500 in five different countries, including the United States.
Super spreaders are a crucial part of a disease outbreak. Think about Mary Mallon, or `` Typhoid Mary, '' who was responsible for widely spreading typhoid in New York City in the early 1900s. Or the Chinese doctor who in 2003 spread SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, to four different countries. Or the single patient at a South Korean hospital who in 2015 infected 82 people with MERS, or Middle East respiratory syndrome.
The Wuhan virus is a cousin of SARS and MERS. All three are coronaviruses.
The presence of a super spreader in Wuhan indicates that the virus can spread with some ease, said Michael Osterholm, an epidemiologist and professor at the University of Minnesota School of Public Health.
He calls them `` super shedders, '' since they shed the virus -- for example, in sneezes or coughs -- in larger quantities than most other people.
`` You only need one super shedder to say, 'This dog is going to hunt, ' `` he said. `` It really does speak to the potential for this virus to be transmitted. ''
He added that there are probably more super spreaders -- or shedders -- of the Wuhan coronavirus than this one patient.
`` If we have one super shedder, that tells us we're going to have more super shedders, '' he said. `` If there's one, there will be more. ''
Osterholm's team at the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy is investigating the super spreader, and their research shows there might be more health care workers in or near Wuhan who 've become infected than the 14 mentioned by the health official earlier this week.
Super spreaders in coronavirus outbreaks
On Tuesday, the mayor of Wuhan said one patient spread the coronavirus to a doctor and 13 nurses.

The mayor, Zhou Xianwang, said a patient wasn't screened for the virus before being admitted to Union Hospital in Wuhan for neurosurgery, and after surgery developed a fever. Zhou, who spoke on CCTV, the state-run television station, did not specify when this occurred.
Osterholm said his team's research shows that 20 health care workers have been infected by patients, with the other six cases possibly at hospitals in Wuhan and the nearby city of Huanggang.
Public health officials are trying to avoid devastating super spreader events that happened with SARS and MERS.
In 2003, a Chinese doctor who was staying at the Metropole Hotel in the city of Guangzhou infected other hotel guests who then traveled back to Vietnam, Hong Kong, Singapore and Canada. In Singapore alone, 94 cases of SARS can be traced back to the hotel, according to WHO.
In 2015, there were five super-spreading events of MERS at hospitals in South Korea. In one case, a single patient spread the infection to 82 other people.
The ramifications were huge. Two South Korean hospitals closed down, nearly 17,000 people had to be quarantined, and the economic loss was estimated at 9.3 trillion Korean won, or $ 8.5 billion. In all, 186 people became infected in the South Korea MERS outbreak and 38 died, according to WHO.",business
423,Global Markets Hit By Fears Over Spreading Virus in China,"European stocks slumped on Tuesday, with worries about a spreading virus in China weighing on equities across the globe.
The Stoxx Europe 600 declined 0.75% to 420.80, joining an Asian markets retreat in response to the coronavirus outbreak that has infected at least 200 people.
The Hang Seng index was walloped by 2.8%, with Hong Kong also impacted by a credit rating downgrade. U.S. stock futures pointed to a triple-digit decline in the Dow Jones Industrial Average after trading resumes after a three-day break.
In Europe, luxury goods producers sensitive to Asian demand took the brunt of losses. Burberry Group fell 3.9% and Gucci owner Kering was down 3.7%.
UBS also dropped, losing over 5% as the Swiss banking group reduced guidance for its return on capital, even as fourth-quarter earnings topped analyst expectations.",business
551,Hong Kong leader Lam insists to stay on to tackle crises,"A confident Carrie Lam said on Wednesday that Hong Kong had several crises to manage, but insisted she was staying on as the Chinese-ruled city’ s leader, dismissing calls to step down.
At times laughing and smiling, Beijing-backed Lam told the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos that she had to stay on to tackle an economic crisis and the coronavirus, which has killed 17 people in mainland China.
Lam is on a mission to the Swiss Alps to reassure global leaders meeting there that the Asian financial center is open for business, despite months of anti-government protests and “ nothing is more important than the rule of law ”.
“ It would be very easy to just run away from a situation. It’ s very difficult to govern and implement policies. For those who understand the political structure, leaving that position vacant would only create more confusion, ” she said.
Lam’ s remarks contrast with comments made in August. In a recording obtained by Reuters she told a private meeting of business people she had caused “ unforgivable havoc ” by igniting the crisis and would quit if allowed to do so.
The coronavirus could not come at a worse time for Hong Kong, whose status as a financial center has come under scrutiny as images of sometimes violent street clashes between police and protesters have been beamed live to the world since June.
“ While people focus on what has happened in Hong Kong, what has not happened in the last months is massive bloodshed on Hong Kong streets.... A curfew has not happened. The gagging of the media has not happened, ” Lam said.
Speaking hours after Hong Kong quarantined a man “ highly suspected ” to have contracted China’ s new flu-like virus, Lam said robust processes were in place and the city had learned lessons from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome ( SARS), which killed nearly 300 people in the city in 2003.
“ My health colleagues are really on guard. With this rapid flow of people across the border we are vulnerable, ” she added.
Tens of millions of Chinese start traveling this week to celebrate Lunar New Year, heightening fears of contagion of the coronavirus, which has killed 17 people in mainland China and rattled global markets.
Memories of the impact of SARS still haunt Hong Kong and any repeat would batter an economy that sank into recession in the third quarter as months of protests took a heavy toll.
Since its return to Beijing in 1997, the former British colony has been governed under a “ one country, two systems ” formula that guarantees it broad freedoms not seen in mainland China, including an independent judiciary and free press.
Some demonstrators accuse Beijing of meddling in the city’ s affairs, which it denies.
The revolt in the global financial center has dealt a major setback to Chinese President Xi Jinping, who said in December Hong Kong’ s situation in 2019 “ was the most complex and difficult since its return to the motherland. ”
Lam said Xi was “ definitely ” committed to the “ one country, two systems ” formula of governance, which was “ sacrosanct ”.

Kirin Beverage Co will launch iMUSE Water ( Mizu) in Japan this month, a product containing Kirin's proprietary probiotic Lactococcus Lactis Strain Plasma.
iMUSE Water is a sugar-free, calorie-free product that can consumed daily for health management. The drink delivers 100 billion Plasma Lactobacillus ​per 500mL. The probiotic is isolated from soured milk.
While the drink is marketed with a wellness element, the product will not hold a Food with Function Claim ( FFC).
The drink will be available at supermarkets, convenience stores, and drug stores from January 14 with a recommended retail price of JPY 120 ( US $ 1).
In earlier clinical studies​, Plasma Lactobacillus ​was found to play a role in immunity; while Kirin is investigating its potential in fighting dengue virus infection, as well as championing its anti-ageing effects.
As part of the Kirin Group Vision 2027 to connect food and medicine, the company's iMUSE brand focuses on health maintenance. Existing products in the range include yogurts, supplements, gummies and beverages.
Bud Light Seltzer is hitting shelves in the US, as one of beer giant AB InBev's entries​ in the booming hard seltzer category.
The first batch of Bud Light Seltzer was delivered to the town of Seltzer in Pennsylvania last month: with a nationwide rollout to follow.
The 5% ABV seltzer is made with cane sugar and natural fruit flavors, and comes in at 100 calories, 2g carbs and < 1g of sugar per serving.

Bud Light Seltzer will be available in a variety 12-pack, single-flavor 12-packs and single-flavor 25 oz cans.
UK company Innovative Functional Foods and Hertfordshire distillery Black Bridge Distillery have joined forces to launch Green Russian Hand-Crafted Vodka and Green Genie Hand Crafted Gin.
The vodka is triple distilled from 100% molasses spirit with an infusion of green tea: ‘ which possesses a depth of flavour that can warm even the coldest and darkest of Moscow nights!’
Meanwhile, Green Genie Hand Crafted Gin is a'smooth, citrus forward gin ', with a blend of 12 botanicals including juniper, Sicilian lemon, Seville orange, White Korean ginseng, coriander seed, angelica root, orris root and Chinese green tea.
Kin creates ‘ functional euphorics’ in beverage and has now launched a new restorative nightcap drink Dream Light. The brand said it is designed to ‘ ease your body and mind’ differently from other sleep supplements and aids on the market.
“ Dream Light was created to enhance the ritual before bed and promotes a state of rest by relaxing muscles, supporting digestion, and regulating temperature. It is also a non-alcoholic beverage so you’ ll never fear a looming hangover, ” ​ Kin said.
The drink contains adaptogens, nootropics and botanics in each 16.9oz bottle. Kin is free from nuts, gluten, dairy and added sugar. It can be sipped warm or chilled, and has an earthy, smokey taste with a spiced finish. It joins Kin’ s existing products, High Rhode and Spritz, which are all available in the US on Kin’ s website.
UK-based Discarded Spirits Co. is adding a fruit-forward rum to its portfolio that blends Caribbean rum and banana peel. The brand has sourced the banana peel from a flavor house that uses the fruit but gets rid of the peel.
The peels are dried out and fermented, then steeped in alcohol for two weeks. The 37.5% ABV rum has a 'fresh toffee note with a fruity balance ', still with the spice and sweetness foundation of a Caribbean rum.
Tom Stannard, Global Marketing Manager, said “ It’ s exciting to see how consumers and bartenders have engaged with Discarded so far. When developing Rum, we wanted to maintain the magic of reuse whilst credibly expanding into a new category.

119,"As retailers continue to struggle, Macy's is closing 28 stores","Hi, what are you looking for?
By
Published
Strange as it may sound, Macy’ s stock is soaring after the company reported sales results for the critical November/December holiday period on Wednesday.
After reporting that same-store sales had declined 0.7 percent over the year, reports USA Today, CEO Jeff Gennette said in a news release, “ Macy’ s, Inc.’ s performance during the holiday season reflected a strong trend improvement from the third quarter, ” adding, “ Additionally, customers responded to our gifting assortment and marketing strategy, particularly in the 10 days before Christmas. ”
Macy’ s has had it tough this year, with stocks down 43 percent over the previous year. But stocks have risen 20 percent over the past three months as of Tuesday’ s closing price, according to Barron’ s. And the 0.7 percent November and December decline was not as bad as had been predicted.
However, despite the seeming “ turn-around ” in business, Macy’ s is still looking to close underperforming stores. Gennette said that the company’ s holiday sales benefited from strong online sales and demand for gift products, and the lower sales were “ steeper than we expected. ”
The big-name department stores are being squeezed out by discount chains, like TJ Maxx and Target, which is pressuring profits and forcing them to put products on sale. This environment has forced retailers like Sears, Forever 21, Pier 1 Imports and others into fighting for their lives.
Last year, U.S. retailers announced 9,302 store closings, a 59 percent jump from 2018 and the highest number since Coresight Research began tracking the data in 2012. As a matter of fact, Coresight lists 729 store closures to date so far in 2020.
Macy’ s says it will provide a full list of its store closures at its upcoming investor day on February 5. For now, we know the Bloomingdales in The Falls mall, which is southwest of Miami, is closing.
Neil Saunders, the managing director of GlobalData Retail, in a statement sent to USA Today, said Macy’ s decision to close its underperforming locations “ a foretaste of things to come if Macy’ s does not invest in and reinvigorate these outlets, ” adding that most of Macy’ s legacy stores “ looked shabby and lacked festive cheer. In our view, they remain unfit for purpose and there is a big question mark over their long-term future. ”

699,"Coronavirus Death Toll Climbs in China, and a Lockdown Widens","This briefing has ended. Read about developments in the coronavirus outbreak here.
The Chinese National Health Commission reported early Friday that there have been 25 deaths from and 830 cases of the coronavirus, a sharp increase.
The death toll increased by more than a half-dozen in 24 hours, while the number of confirmed cases jumped by more than 200.
Earlier, the first death was confirmed outside the virus epicenter.
A patient died in the province of Hebei — more than 600 miles north of the city where the outbreak began — after contracting the coronavirus, the provincial authorities announced on Thursday.
The victim was an 80-year-old man who had lived in the city of Wuhan, where the outbreak originated, for more than two months, according to Hebei’ s provincial health department. Wuhan is a major port city of 11 million in the province of Hubei, where all of the 17 previously reported deaths have taken place.
The victim died on Wednesday, but officials did not confirm that he had died of the coronavirus until Thursday, the Hebei provincial announcement said.
The announcement did not say when the man had returned to Hebei Province from Wuhan, but said that he had developed chest tightness and difficulty breathing after his return. Like many of the other confirmed victims of the virus, he appeared to have other underlying health issues: After being admitted to a hospital, he also was treated for high blood pressure, chronic bronchitis and emphysema, the authorities said.
After two days of deliberations, an emergency committee convened by the World Health Organization decided not to declare a global health emergency — but planned to meet again within 10 days, acknowledging the “ urgency ” of the situation.
The committee had first planned to issue a recommendation on Wednesday about whether to declare an emergency ( the decision ultimately falls to the W.H.O.’ s director general). Such a declaration would give the W.H.O. broader authority to shape different countries’ responses. But committee members were split.
On Thursday, after news of Wuhan’ s travel restrictions and the increased death count emerged, the committee met again, and decided not to recommend the declaration. Several members thought it was “ still too early, ” the W.H.O. said in a news release.
Agency officials explained that although the disease has reached beyond China, the number of cases in other countries is still relatively small, and the disease does not seem to be spreading within those countries.
“ At this time, there is no evidence of human to human transmission outside China, ” Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the W.H.O.’ s director general, said at a news conference in Geneva. “ That doesn’ t mean it won’ t happen. ”
“ Make no mistake, ” he said. “ This is an emergency in China, but it has not yet become a global health emergency. It may yet become one. ”
Only five global public health emergency declarations have been made in the past. The decisions are fraught, with health authorities wary of causing panic, or of suggesting that governments can not handle outbreaks on their own.
Still, the W.H.O. called on the Chinese government to share more information on how it was handling the crisis.

The authorities expanded travel restrictions to several Chinese cities near Wuhan hours after announcing that the death toll and number of cases had risen sharply. Currently, at least 18 victims have been confirmed dead and more than 600 infected, according to Chinese officials.
The restrictions on train and other forms of travel will apply to tens of millions of people and come just days before the Lunar New Year holiday, when hundreds of millions of people travel around and out of the country.
The Chinese authorities on Thursday morning closed off Wuhan by canceling flights and trains leaving the city, and suspending buses, subways and ferries within it. Late on Thursday, the local authorities also announced that they would suspend for-hire vehicles and limit taxis, beginning at noon on Friday.
Roughly 30,000 people fly out of Wuhan on an average day, according to air traffic data. Many more leave using ground transportation like trains and cars.
By evening, officials planned to also close off Huanggang, a city of seven million about 30 miles east of Wuhan, shut rail stations in the nearby city of Ezhou, which has about one million residents, and impose travel restrictions on the smaller cities of Chibi and Zhijiang.
In Huanggang, public transportation and departing trains stopped at midnight. Residents are not allowed to leave the city without special permission, according to a government statement. In Ezhou, all rail stations were to be closed.
Separately, the provincial authorities in Hubei announced late Thursday some restrictions for the entire province, not just specific cities. Travel agencies are prohibited from taking customers and organizing tours, for example, and business trips are being suspended.
Schools throughout the province, which have breaks scheduled for the Lunar New Year holiday, will postpone their post-break start dates indefinitely.
The new virus, which first emerged at the end of December, has sickened people in Taiwan, Vietnam, Japan, Thailand, Singapore, South Korea and the United States. It has raised the specter of a repeat of the SARS epidemic, which broke out in China in 2002 and 2003 and spread rapidly while officials obscured the seriousness of the crisis. That virus eventually killed more than 800 people worldwide.
In Beijing, the government said it would cancel large public gatherings for the holiday, including fairs at temples that usually draw shoulder-to-shoulder crowds, and the Forbidden City, a popular tourist attraction in the heart of the capital, will close starting on Saturday.
Coronaviruses are named for the spikes that protrude from their membranes, which resemble the sun’ s corona. They can infect both animals and people, and cause illnesses of the respiratory tract, ranging from the common cold to severe conditions like SARS.
Symptoms of infection include a high fever, difficulty breathing and lung lesions. Milder cases may resemble the flu or a bad cold, making detection difficult. The incubation period — the time from exposure to the onset of symptoms — is believed to be about two weeks.
While the headlines are alarming, health experts cautioned that it was too early to gauge the severity of the outbreak. There are too many unknowns: Where did it start? How easily does it spread? How does it compare to other coronaviruses, like SARS?
Dr. William Schaffner, a specialist in infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, said the illness should be viewed in perspective. While a new virus spreading internationally gets more attention, the much more common influenza virus is the bigger hazard for most people, he said.
“ If I look at this winter respiratory season, influenza is going to cause many more illnesses and more deaths than this coronavirus, ” he said. “ It’ s one of those circumstances where, if familiarity doesn’ t breed contempt, it certainly breeds a certain nonchalance. ”
The virus has sickened tens of thousands of people in China and a number of other countries.
As anxiety about the virus has grown, governments around the world have taken precautions to isolate anyone displaying symptoms, though several cases have proved not to be the coronavirus.
Health officials in the United States said on Thursday that there could be a second infection in the country, after the authorities in Washington State confirmed earlier this week that a man there had fallen sick with the Wuhan coronavirus. The second possible patient was in Brazos County, Texas, where officials said they were keeping a patient isolated at home while they did additional testing.
Vietnam’ s Ministry of Health announced on Thursday that it had confirmed two cases of the coronavirus, in two male Chinese patients.
In Mexico, two out of five potential coronavirus cases were officially ruled out by the Health Ministry on Thursday after comprehensive tests were conducted, according to state and federal government officials.
A health official said that one of the patients, a 57-year-old professor, had been diagnosed with a common cold.
The three other cases, in the western state of Jalisco, were under observation and were being tested, according to the Health Ministry report. The patients include a 42-year old man who returned to Mexico from Wuhan on Jan. 10, and two other women who had contact with him.
Across Wuhan on Thursday, residents — some wearing masks, some sniffing or coughing — visited hospitals and clinics seeking treatment. In interviews with a New York Times correspondent in the city, some said they were angry about the sudden lockdown. Others said they were confused by the restrictions.
Outside the Wuhan No. 3 Hospital, Yang Lin, said she had come to the hospital to see if a sniffling cold she had might be the coronavirus. After a quick check, the doctors told her not to worry. But she was not reassured.
“ They said it was just a common cold, and told me to get some medicine and go home, ” Ms. Yang, 28, said. “ But how am I to know? They didn’ t even take my temperature. It’ s just not responsible. ”
The outbreak is testing Wuhan’ s health care system. Several Wuhan residents said on social media websites that they had gone from hospital to hospital, waiting in lines for hours, only to be sent home with medicine and instructions to seek further treatment later if symptoms persisted in a few days.
Doctors told some patients that there was a shortage of hospital beds as well as testing kits, according to posts on Chinese social media sites.
China’ s Ministry of Finance said on Thursday that it would allocate 1 billion yuan, or about $ 144 million, to officials in Hubei to fight the virus, though it did not specify how the money would be used.
Wuhan officials also said that they would construct a new hospital specifically for coronavirus patients. The new hospital was ordered built within six days, according to People’ s Daily, the ruling Communist Party’ s main newspaper.
Cheng Shidong, a doctor at the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, said in an interview that his hospital had set up 100 beds to receive infected patients, but that it didn’ t have enough protective material, such as masks and suits, for the medical staff.
In Wuhan, Ms. Yang said that while she was in a pharmacy buying medicine, another person complained that he thought he had the coronavirus but had not been isolated. The city’ s medical system, especially its smaller hospitals, seems unprepared for the influx of patients, she said.
“ I’ m willing to accept that we have to stay in Wuhan, O.K., but the medical care needs to keep up, ” she said. “ You shouldn’ t tell us we can’ t leave, and then give us second-rate medical care. That’ s unfair. ”
China’ s health commission, which has tightly controlled news about the toll of the outbreak, released on Thursday its most detailed list of the people who have died of the disease.
The first 17 people were largely older men, many with underlying health problems. All died in Hubei Province, which includes the city of Wuhan.
The first confirmed death was a 61-year-old man who went to a hospital in Wuhan on December 27, weak with a fever and a cough. He was transferred to another hospital as his condition worsened, and he was later attached to a machine that helped oxygenate his blood. But he died on Jan. 9.
Twelve of the other 17 deaths in Hubei were also men, and four were women, officials said. The youngest victim was a 48-year-old woman who died on Monday. The oldest were two 89-year-old men.
Separately on Thursday, the health authorities in Hebei Province, to the north of Hubei Province, announced that an 80-year-old man there had died, bringing the death count to 18.
Many of the victims had underlying conditions like cirrhosis of the liver, hypertension, diabetes and Parkinson’ s disease. Most had gone to the hospital with a fever and a cough, though at least three had no fever when they were admitted, according to the health commission.
While a full picture of the virus is still unknown, medical experts found positive signs in the fact that the disease did not appear to be killing young and otherwise healthy people.
“ The majority of fatal cases are elderly and/or have a chronic disease that would increase their susceptibility to infectious diseases, ” said Dr. W. Ian Lipkin, an epidemiologist at the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University in New York.
In an unusually blunt interview, Dr. Guan Yi, a professor of infectious diseases in Hong Kong and expert on SARS, criticized the authorities in Wuhan for acting too slowly and obstructing his efforts to investigate the outbreak.
Updated June 12, 2020
Touching contaminated objects and then infecting ourselves with the germs is not typically how the virus spreads. But it can happen. A number of studies of flu, rhinovirus, coronavirus and other microbes have shown that respiratory illnesses, including the new coronavirus, can spread by touching contaminated surfaces, particularly in places like day care centers, offices and hospitals. But a long chain of events has to happen for the disease to spread that way. The best way to protect yourself from coronavirus — whether it’ s surface transmission or close human contact — is still social distancing, washing your hands, not touching your face and wearing masks.
So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited paper published in April suggests that people are most infectious about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms. Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have symptoms was “ very rare, ” but she later walked back that statement.
A study by European scientists is the first to document a strong statistical link between genetic variations and Covid-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus. Having Type A blood was linked to a 50 percent increase in the likelihood that a patient would need to get oxygen or to go on a ventilator, according to the new study.
The unemployment rate fell to 13.3 percent in May, the Labor Department said on June 5, an unexpected improvement in the nation’ s job market as hiring rebounded faster than economists expected. Economists had forecast the unemployment rate to increase to as much as 20 percent, after it hit 14.7 percent in April, which was the highest since the government began keeping official statistics after World War II. But the unemployment rate dipped instead, with employers adding 2.5 million jobs, after more than 20 million jobs were lost in April.
Mass protests against police brutality that have brought thousands of people onto the streets in cities across America are raising the specter of new coronavirus outbreaks, prompting political leaders, physicians and public health experts to warn that the crowds could cause a surge in cases. While many political leaders affirmed the right of protesters to express themselves, they urged the demonstrators to wear face masks and maintain social distancing, both to protect themselves and to prevent further community spread of the virus. Some infectious disease experts were reassured by the fact that the protests were held outdoors, saying the open air settings could mitigate the risk of transmission.
Exercise researchers and physicians have some blunt advice for those of us aiming to return to regular exercise now: Start slowly and then rev up your workouts, also slowly. American adults tended to be about 12 percent less active after the stay-at-home mandates began in March than they were in January. But there are steps you can take to ease your way back into regular exercise safely. First, “ start at no more than 50 percent of the exercise you were doing before Covid, ” says Dr. Monica Rho, the chief of musculoskeletal medicine at the Shirley Ryan AbilityLab in Chicago. Thread in some preparatory squats, too, she advises. “ When you haven’ t been exercising, you lose muscle mass. ” Expect some muscle twinges after these preliminary, post-lockdown sessions, especially a day or two later. But sudden or increasing pain during exercise is a clarion call to stop and return home.
States are reopening bit by bit. This means that more public spaces are available for use and more and more businesses are being allowed to open again. The federal government is largely leaving the decision up to states, and some state leaders are leaving the decision up to local authorities. Even if you aren’ t being told to stay at home, it’ s still a good idea to limit trips outside and your interaction with other people.
Common symptoms include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath. Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less common. The C.D.C. has also added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.
If air travel is unavoidable, there are some steps you can take to protect yourself. Most important: Wash your hands often, and stop touching your face. If possible, choose a window seat. A study from Emory University found that during flu season, the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window, as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people. Disinfect hard surfaces. When you get to your seat and your hands are clean, use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest, the seatbelt buckle, the remote, screen, seat back pocket and the tray table. If the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather, you can wipe that down, too. ( Using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them.)
Taking one’ s temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds, as “ normal ” temperature numbers can vary, but generally, keep an eye out for a temperature of 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit or higher. If you don’ t have a thermometer ( they can be pricey these days), there are other ways to figure out if you have a fever, or are at risk of Covid-19 complications.
The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now, the C.D.C., like the W.H.O., has advised that ordinary people don’ t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’ t replace hand washing and social distancing.
If you’ ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have, and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested, how to get tested, and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others.
If you’ re sick and you think you’ ve been exposed to the new coronavirus, the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’ s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’ re asymptomatic, for instance — you won’ t be able to get tested.
Dr. Guan, who helped successfully identify the coronavirus that caused SARS during the 2002-2003 outbreak in China, told the influential Chinese magazine Caixin that he was deeply frustrated by the city government’ s response to the spread of the virus.
He and his team had visited Wuhan on Tuesday hoping that they could track the animal that was the source of the coronavirus but were shocked to find that residents at a market were not taking any precautions or wearing masks. No special measures were in place at the airport to disinfect surfaces and floors, either. This showed that the city government was being complacent despite the urgent orders handed down by Beijing, he said.
“ I thought at the time, we had to be in a ‘ state of war’, but how come the alarm has not been raised? ” he told Caixin. “ Poor citizens, they were still preparing to ring in the New Year in peace and had no sense about the epidemic. ”
He also criticized the local authorities for disinfecting the market where many infections had been traced to, saying that made it difficult for researchers to investigate where the virus came from.
“ I consider myself a veteran in battles, ” he said, citing his experience with bird flu, SARS, and other outbreaks. “ But with this Wuhan pneumonia, I feel extremely powerless. ”

There are growing concerns that the Chinese authorities are underreporting the number of people who are ill with the virus. Relatives of patients say that some hospitals, strapped for resources as they deal with an influx of patients, are turning sick people away or refusing to test them for the coronavirus.
Many people remain skeptical of the government’ s official statistics, with memories of the effort to cover up the severity of the SARS outbreak still fresh.
In Wuhan, Kyle Hui, an architect from Shanghai, said that doctors at Tongji Hospital declined to test his stepmother for the virus, even though she was showing symptoms like a cough and a fever. She died on Jan. 15 of “ severe pneumonia, ” according to a copy of her death certificate.
Mr. Hui said that hospital workers treated his stepmother as if she had the coronavirus, wearing hazmat suits. After she died, the hospital instructed the family to cremate the body immediately. Mr. Hui said that after her death, doctors informed the family that they suspected his stepmother had the coronavirus.
“ I’ m very sad my stepmother left without any dignity, ” Mr. Hui said during an interview this week in a cafe in Wuhan. “ There was no time to say goodbye. ”
Chris Buckley, our chief China correspondent, headed to Wuhan from Beijing to cover the outbreak. He is sending live dispatches from his trip.
11 a.m. — Aboard the G79 high speed train
The G79 high speed train from Beijing to Hong Kong, which stops in Wuhan, was crowded with holiday passengers. The train was a hubbub of conversation, much of it about the deadly coronavirus and the lockdown around Wuhan.
Guo Jing, a worker from northeast China, was headed with two friends for a holiday in Macau. After some hesitation, they had taken off their masks. “ They’ re too uncomfortable inside, ” Mr. Guo said. “ My view is we have to be careful but not panic. If you’ re the panicky type, then you wouldn’ t be on this train. ”
1:37 p.m. — Aboard the G79 high speed train
Half an hour out from Wuhan, the train is quite crowded with passengers. When I explain that I’ m getting off at Wuhan, the reactions vary from advice — wear masks, don’ t go, drink lots of water — to mordant jokes that I may be there a long time.
“ You should know that they probably won’ t let people out until the New Year holiday is over, ” said one woman, who would only give her family name, Yang.
2:29 p.m. — Wuhan
Wuhan Railway Station, usually thronging with people in the days before the Lunar New Year holiday, is very empty. An announcement playing on a loop over the speakers tells the few people here that residents can not leave the city and the station is temporarily closed.
Scientists have been scrambling to understand the source of the coronavirus, in particular, the animals from which the virus may have jumped to humans. Many of the cases in Wuhan were connected to a market that sold live poultry and exotic animal meats. The market was closed and disinfected.
Early epidemiological research is indicating that it may have come from wild animals such as bamboo rats and badgers, said Dr. Zhong Nanshan, a prominent Chinese scientist who was the country’ s leading expert during the SARS outbreak, during an interview with state media on Monday. Named for its bamboo-heavy diet, the cat-sized bamboo rat has become a somewhat popular delicacy in recent years in China, promoted for its purported health properties.
A group of Chinese researchers from the eastern city of Tianjin and Nanjing in the south, said the Wuhan coronavirus may have originated from Chinese horseshoe bats, according to a study they published in the Chinese Journal of Bioinformatics on Tuesday.
China’ s National Genomics Data Center said the Wuhan virus was 88 percent genetically similar to a SARS-like coronavirus that was collected from bats in China in 2017.
Still another group of Chinese scientists suggested that snakes were the “ most probable wildlife animal reservoir ” for the novel coronavirus, then transmitted to humans, in an article published in the Journal of Medical Virology Wednesday.
But that assessment immediately drew fire from the international health community.
The study’ s lead author, Wei Ji of the Peking University Health Science Center School of Basic Medical Sciences, did not actually find the new coronavirus in a snake, noted David Robertson, a professor at the University of Glasgow. Instead, Dr. Ji and his colleagues compared the genomes of an assortment of viruses and hosts and claimed to find a similarity between the genomes of the new virus and snakes.
Dr. Ji did not respond to an email query by the time of publication.
The announcement that the city of Wuhan would be temporarily sealed off from the outside world starting at 10 a.m. on Thursday came while most residents were asleep at 2 a.m.
Some decided to flee the city.
Residents were seen hauling their luggage to a train station in the early hours before the citywide lockdown took effect, the Chinese news outlet Caixin reported. Several people said they would buy tickets for any destination as long as they could leave Wuhan, the magazine reported.
Lines of passengers in masks and down jackets, lugging suitcases, formed outside the major Hankou railway station just 20 minutes before the cutoff time, a live video by media outlet The Paper showed.
Han Zhen and Wang Mengkai, two migrant workers from Henan Province, said they had rushed to the railway station in order to leave on Wednesday night, but missed the last train out.
Both said they were frustrated by the sudden lockdown and were scrambling to find a way home.
“ It’ s serious but not that serious, ” said Mr. Wang, who works in an electronics parts factory. “ We’ re trying to figure out how we can get home. If we can’ t get out on a train, we’ ll try putting together a car with a driver. ”
Asked if they were motivated to leave by fear of the virus, Mr. Han said: “ No, we are not scared. ”
“ It’ s the New Year, we just have to go home, ” he said.

930,Where has coronavirus spread?,"China remains the centre of the outbreak of a deadly coronavirus, with cases and deaths heavily concentrated in Hubei province and its capital, Wuhan. Cases have been reported in other countries around the world as health authorities scramble to prevent a pandemic.
Authorities in China have placed at least 20 cities on lockdown as they battle to contain the spread. Travel restrictions have been imposed in cities across Hubei province where the outbreak originated. Wholesale closure of transport infrastructure has taken place across the region, affecting the movement of at least 36 million people. Infections have been confirmed in almost all of China’ s provinces, as well as the municipalities of Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing and Tianjin.
The outbreak is centred on the city of Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province and home to more than 11 million people. Efforts have begun to build a 1,000-bed hospital in a matter of days to relieve pressure on existing Wuhan medical facilities that have been overwhelmed with patients. There have also been reports of empty supermarket shelves and barricades going up.
Wuhan’ s international airport serves 104 destinations including 29 outside China. There are three direct flights a week from Wuhan to Heathrow, where arrivals from the affected city will now enter through a separate area. Screening has started at the three US airports where Wuhan flights land. Checks are also in place at airports in the other east Asian countries that have confirmed the virus is present.
France has identified three cases. Authorities say two of the three infected people belong to the same family. One of the patients, a 48-year-old man, passed through Wuhan. He was in contact with about 10 people before he was taken into care.
In Australia, three patients in New South Wales and one in Victoria have been diagnosed with the virus.
Malaysia confirmed its first three cases on Saturday. All are Chinese nationals on holiday from Wuhan who arrived in the country from Singapore two days earlier.
Canada said it discovered its first case, a man is his 50s who recently flew from Wuhan to Guangzhou and then on to Toronto.
US health officials have announced three positive tests.
Japan’ s health authorities in Japan – a destination for many lunar new year holidaymakers – confirmed a second case on Friday.
Singapore has announced at least four cases: A 66-year-old man and his 37-year-old son, who arrived in Singapore on Monday from Wuhan, a 52-year-old Wuhan woman, who arrived in the city-state on Tuesday, and a 36-year-old man from Wuhan who sought treatment on 24 January and was immediately isolated.
Elsewhere, South Korea’ s government confirmed its third case, while two cases have been confirmed in Vietnam. Thailand’ s public health ministry has confirmed five cases. Taiwan has reported three cases and Macao two.
The Wuhan coronavirus is mainly spread through the respiratory tract. A seafood market selling wild animals in Wuhan is the suspected source of the virus. Scientists believe it probably jumped from an animal to a human and is now transmissible from one person to another, and could mutate further.
Comparisons have been drawn with the Sars outbreak in 2003, which was similarly caused by a coronavirus. China’ s handling of Sars was criticised because it played down the first cases. The virus spread to 37 countries, causing global panic, infecting almost 8,500 people and killing almost 1,000.",general
197,TCL SOCL 500TWS wireless earbuds hands-on: High end specifications and decent performance for $ 80,"Wireless earbuds are becoming the standard for enjoying audio content from your smartphone, tablet, or smartwatch. TCL released an affordable option that may not have the sleekest design, yet performs well.
It's often said you get what you pay for so I didn't have high expectations for the new TCL SOCL 500TWS fully wireless earbuds when they were offered up for review. After a couple of weeks of wearing them during my commute, while running, and while working I am impressed by these earbuds that are available for less than half the cost of most competitors.
While I have been running with the new Jabra Elite Active 75t for the past couple of weeks and I have yet to hear another fully wireless headset that can match its audio quality, those also have a MSRP of $ 199 so you have to be pretty serious about your audio quality, style, and functionality.
Given that 3.5mm audio jacks are becoming a rarity on mobile devices, wireless Bluetooth headsets are becoming the norm. Millions are not willing to pay hundreds for the latest in wireless audio so it's nice to see TCL offer up something more affordable that still performs well.
The retail package includes the two wireless earbuds, a charging case with integrated battery, a short USB-A to USB-C cable, and small/medium/large silicone gel earbud tips. I tested the Phantom Black model, but TCL offers three other colorful options for these earbuds.
The charging case is about the size of an Apple AirPods charging case, but has more curves so it comfortably slips into your pocket. The top flap opens up to reveal the earbuds and this material is thin plastic, giving it a bit of a cheap feel. I haven't seen this material impact the usability or functionality at all though so it's understandable some areas had to be compromised for the $ 80 price.
There is a battery status indicator button on the back so you can check how much battery is remaining in the case. Each LED indicates a 25% charge level. The case is thankfully charged up via a modern USB-C port on the bottom. This was unexpected, but very much appreciated, as lower priced accessories still tend to use microUSB.
The earbuds are secured in place magnetically so even if the top flap is open the earbuds stay securely in the case. A small LED on each earbud lights up when each earbud is charging and turns off when the earbuds are fully charged.
After pairing to a device, always take out the right earbud first to initiate the connection to your device and then when the left earbud is removed the two will connect and switch you into stereo mode. The right earbud can be used as a separate earbud, but the left earbud is a slave to the right earbud and can not be used alone.
The earbuds are fairly small, nearly the same size and look as the Samsung Galaxy Buds, with a share part that holds a silicone tip that fits into your ear. Each earbud is very lightweight and can be worn comfortably for hours.
On the outside of each earbud is the TCL brand name and this area also serves as a button that is easy to activate. While listening to music, you can press the button on either side to play/pause music, twice on the right side to increase volume, twice on the left bud to decrease volume, press/hold on the right to go to the next track, and press/hold on the left to go to the previous track. Less functionality is available in mono mode when you have just the right earbud inserted.
Call controls are limited and include a single press to answer or end a call and a press and hold to reject an incoming call. The right and left earbuds perform the same functions for calls.
You can also use the TCL earbuds for your selected voice assistant. Press the button on either earbud three times to initiate Google Assistant or Siri.
The design and silicone tips allowed me to find a comfortable setup for the TCL SOCL500TWS earbuds for commuting and running. They stayed in my ears when running, unlike the new AirPods Pro.
These TCL earbuds don't have the best audio performance when listening to music, but the volume is good and the sound is decent. The clarity present on higher end earbuds isn't there, but it is honestly better than I expected for an inexpensive wireless headset.
Callers said I sounded like I was on a wireless headset, but again they were not terrible or outstanding.
The button takes a bit of pressure to activate so you end up pressing the earbuds into your ear canal a bit to control the audio. This might not be a major issue for most, but can be annoying when running and bouncing around on the road.
Overall, I found the earbuds acceptable and if I needed to save money and buy something under $ 100 I would consider them. However, I experienced some finicky behavior that was quite frustrating. The right earbud would connect to the mobile device without a problem and perform as expected. However, the left earbud often would not connect to the right earbud so I was often inserting and removing the earbuds to try to get the connection setup.
While the manual states the left earbud acts as a slave to the right earbud, I had both connected individually and independently to the Note 10 Plus. The problem was that these were completely separate pairings so I could only use one earbud to listen in mono mode. I had to start the pairing up again after resetting the earbuds to try to get the mode I wanted, and expected, to work.
While $ 80 is a decent price for a pair of fully wireless earbuds, I personally would rather pick up older model headsets that offer better consistency in pairing and higher quality audio. For example, you can find Amazon renewed Jabra Elite 65t models for $ 70 to $ 75.

690,Microsoft’ s software plan for the Duo Android phone is surprisingly realistic,"Welcome back to Processor, a mostly daily newsletter mostly about computers, by which I mostly mean the consumer electronics industry at large. I’ m Dieter and if you already know all of the above, thanks for sticking around. If you’ re new, welcome!
I’ m going to leave the analysis of the truly bonkers story of Jeff Bezos’ phone hack to Casey Newton’ s newsletter, The Interface. Go subscribe now. He’ s drafting it as I write these words and it contains Very Practical Advice like “ Never open a WhatsApp message from the crown prince of Saudi Arabia. ”
For me and my personal obsession with the various ways companies are trying to reinvent the computer and computer interfaces, the most exciting story of the day was Microsoft releasing a bunch of software tools for its upcoming dual-screen Android phone, the Duo. It includes the necessary bits to build Android apps that are aware of the hinge and its various positions and even some proposed web standards so web pages can do the same.
I promise the previous very nerdy paragraph has implications that matter to more than just Android developers.

I am really into Microsoft’ s developer tools for a lot of reasons — especially the various proposals for making the web work better on dual-screen devices, which in theory could help everybody. But the most important thing is the overall context: Microsoft has the horse and cart in the right order. It’ s trying to get the software right before it releases the hardware.
There have been two big problems with foldable devices thus far: 1. the screens are too fragile and 2. Android is not great on tablets and so the windowing systems have been kind of bad. ( And, well, a third big problem is that they have been super expensive.)
I have no idea when the fragility thing will be fixed, but I like that Microsoft isn’ t bothering with a flexible display. It compromised on whiz-bang hardware to make something more durable and, in many ways, elegant. But the trade-off is that there’ s a big ol’ seam between the Duo’ s two screens. That’ s the cart.
The horse, then, is how the software is designed to deal with that trade-off. ( This is a bad metaphor because I don’ t know what goes in the cart but we’ re in too deep to turn back now.) The details of Microsoft’ s answer to “ how does Android work on a dual-screen device ” all seem really smart.
Windows Central’ s Zac Bowden installed the emulator and made a little video showing how windows move around and it’ s refreshingly simple. Apps open on a single screen, you go into the multitasking view and drag them to move them across to the other screen, or you move them over the seam for some kind of split-screen.
There are different ways to split-screen: sometimes there’ s a list on one side and details on the other, sometimes there’ s two pages like on a book, and sometimes the canvas covers the whole thing and you just have to deal with the seam.
All that is fine, but it’ s not the smart part. Just because Microsoft appears to have created an elegant SDK doesn’ t mean that anybody will actually use it. We’ ve seen Microsoft try and fail to woo mobile developers before. RIP Windows Phone, we still miss ya.
But for the Duo, it’ s even worse than that. We’ ve watched Google struggle to get Android developers to make better big-screen layouts for their apps for years to disappointing results. Android tablets have gone the way of the dodo and Android apps on Chrome OS are best used in small doses.
So the way Microsoft appears to have dealt with that reality is one reason that I’ m actually more hopeful today than I was yesterday about the Duo’ s chances. That’ s because even if literally nobody customizes their Android apps for the Duo, it should still work pretty well. Instead of pinning the Duo’ s chances on the nearly impossible task of getting Android developers to invest resources in a completely new and untested phone, Microsoft is working with where the ecosystem is today.
The key reason is that Microsoft explicitly says that apps will only open on one screen by default and in fact, apps will not be allowed to open up on both screens — that can only happen if a user drags a window into that state.
Your app by default will occupy a single screen, but users can span the app to cover both screens when the device is in a double-portrait or double-landscape layout. You can programmatically enable full-screen mode for your app at any time, but spanning is limited to user activity for now.
It has the very practical benefit of working better with existing Android apps by default. Instead of being annoyed that many apps are kind of junky and poorly-designed in a tablet screen context, the entry experience will just be two normal Android apps, side by side. Android apps generally look alright on portrait, phone-style screens — and that’ s the way they’ ll launch on the Duo.
So even in the worst case scenario where only Microsoft’ s own apps are aware of the hinge, the Duo will still work. It’ s like the theory of progressive enhancement ( and graceful degradation) in web design, but applied to dual-screen Android apps. It’ s smart because, frankly, the worst-case scenario also happens to be the most likely scenario at launch.
Only allowing users to choose when to make apps span two screens adds a level of predictability that will be important for users to built up their intuitions for how things work on the dual-screen device. ( Side note: I have a whole rant about how there’ s no such thing as “ intuitive ” design in software, it’ s all learned.)
Assuming it all works, users won’ t be forced to learn a whole series of gestures and layouts and grids and whatever. Instead, they’ ll just be able to move stuff around and let the software do the right thing.
It is, pardon the alliteration, programmatically pragmatic.
None of this guarantees that the Duo will be any good or that my relative optimism will be rewarded. I’ m just glad that Microsoft isn’ t setting the whole situation up for immediate failure from the jump. There’ s simply very little chance that a ton of Android apps will be customized for the Duo’ s dual screens for launch, but that hopefully won’ t matter.
Speaking of things that aren’ t guaranteed: Windows 10X. The developer tools for that OS are still forthcoming and the questions about how it will operate are much more numerous than for the Duo. Given how many PC manufacturers are waiting for that OS for their foldables, the stakes for Windows 10X are much higher.
As Tom Warren noted yesterday, we should expect to see more at Microsoft’ s Build developers’ conference in May. If there were ever a time for Microsoft to be a little less hand-wavy about 10X, that will be it.

It’ s still $ 1499 and it’ s coming out just days before Samsung is expected to announce its own flip phone. But when people think flip phone, they think Razr, so Motorola still has a good chance even though it’ s up against a bigger company. A real question in my mind is how big this launch will actually be. Will Verizon, because it has an exclusive, try to make this a huge deal with tons of marketing?
During the announcement, Motorola acted supremely confident in the Razr’ s reliability and battery life. How much oomph gets put into the retail launch will say a lot about how real that confidence was.

M & A stayed surprisingly strong, but cracks are beginning to show.
Di Les Baird, David Harding, Andrei Vorobyov and Shikha Dhar
This article is Section 1 of Bain’ s 2020 Global Corporate M & A Report. Explore the contents of the report here or download the PDF to read the full report.
Worries about the global economy and a potential downturn dominated executive discussions in 2019. There were major geopolitical issues to deal with, too, headlined by the chaotic path to Brexit and US-China trade tensions. Executives also grappled with rising regulator intervention in dealmaking that dampened spirits, most notably in Europe. While it has never been easy being an M & A decision maker, the past year introduced multiple layers of unease.
The numbers bear this out. The expectation going into 2019 was that a moderation in deal volumes would resume. The year, however, turned out to be surprisingly resilient. The deal count for 2019 was only 2% lower than 2018, and deal values increased by 1% year over year ( see Figure 1.1). Strong megadeal activity in the US in the first half of 2019 was balanced out by a slower second half. In Europe and Asia, the opposite occurred: The year started slowly and then started to pick up.
In a bit of a surprise, at least to us, transaction multiples are now on par with the 15-year average ( see Figure 1.2). This is true across all industries except technology and consumer products, where multiples are still higher than the long-term average—a situation that could change in a world of slowing economic growth.
Amid trade wars and higher regulatory scrutiny on grounds of national interest, cross-regional deal value declined by 31% during the first nine months of 2019 vs. the same period in 2018 and continued a three-year decline in volume.
Despite slowing economic growth in 2019, capital conditions remained favorable, with low interest rates. We expect the interplay of economic growth and cost of capital to continue to determine the fate of deal volumes in the year ahead.
Within this moderate M & A environment, the nature of dealmaking continues to evolve. Historically, the biggest deals were rooted in scale economics, capturing the benefits of cost and customer overlap by becoming a larger player in an industry. As we introduced in last year’ s report, the fundamental justification for many deals has now shifted to a scope orientation—that is, more deals are predicated on getting into faster-growing lines of business or acquiring new capabilities. That trend intensified in 2019. Often the intent is to garner both growth and capabilities.
Scope deals comprised nearly 60% of all large deals in the year ended September 2019 vs. 40% in 2015 ( see “ About the methodology ” for more details on Bain’ s approach to classifying approximately 1,200 strategic deals). Among deals with disclosed values of more than $ 1 billion, the absolute dollar amount spent on scope deals rose 50% from 2015 to 2018, while the dollar amount spent on scale deals halved.
This rise in scope M & A is a response to business model disruption and low growth. Top-line growth rates continue to trend downward for the leading publicly traded companies ( see Figure 1.3).
The trend toward scope M & A also indicates that most executives are engaged in a strategic shuffling of portfolios. Many are grappling with the need to migrate their portfolios from successful but slower-growing legacy businesses to new growth engines.
With economic concerns top of mind, it is good to remind ourselves that recessions are a moving target and that for most of us, market timing has not been a winning strategy. What we do know for sure is this: Every downturn produces its winners and losers. The winners prepare by using scale and scope M & A and divestitures proactively to reshape their portfolios.
This article is part of Bain’ s 2020 Global Corporate M & A Report. Explore the contents of the report here or download the PDF to read the full report.
To understand the nature of M & A activity, we first identified the top 250 strategic deals of each year ( top 165 strategic deals for 2019 year-to-date until September, since the analysis was concluded in October). From the initial list of deals with values greater than $ 1 billion, as reported by Dealogic, we excluded nonstrategic deals. These include asset or property acquisitions, financial investments, internal reorganizations, and minority stake acquisitions.We then classified the strategic deals into scale or scope deals based on our proprietary framework applied consistently across the years. The proprietary framework uses the stated strategic rationale by the acquirer at the time of announcement to identify the key elements of the deal thesis. Based on these elements, the deals were categorized as scale or scope deals.
Scale deals are intended to strengthen market leadership and lower cost position through the benefits of scale, such as cost synergies. Scope deals are intended to accelerate top-line growth by entering or expanding into faster-growing market segments, or by bringing in new capabilities. In reality, some deals are a blend of both scale and scope; however, the vast majority lean toward one or the other ( see chart).
In partnership with the Gerson Lehrman Group, we conducted a survey of 247 senior executives on the topic of corporate M & A and divestitures. The survey ran throughout July 2019 in the US, UK, Germany, France, China, Australia and Japan. Survey participants were from companies with greater than $ 500 million in annual revenue and held senior executive roles in the capacity of CEO, CFO or head of strategy/business development/M & A.
The survey covered the topics of portfolio management best practices, divestiture decision making and keys to success as well as M & A success drivers for scale and scope deals.

19,"On the road to AI adoption, execs grapple with expertise and data","CIOs kicked off 2019 with AI as an item to watch in the competition agenda. In 2020, adoption of this technology is more likely to predict market dominance.
The levels of adoption cited in the IBM study add confirmation to the trend of increased AI usage. Gartner's CIO survey, published in January 2019, found 37% of enterprise leaders had adopted AI or planned to do so shortly.
`` If you are a CIO and your organization doesn't use AI, chances are high that your competitors do and this should be a concern, '' said Chris Howard, distinguished research vice president at Gartner, in the press release accompanying the survey.
Amid a landscape marked by augmented workers and redefined business models, companies that fail to overcome the knowledge, data and tool barriers to AI adoption are at risk of ceding ground to the competition.
It's a trend IBM hopes to capitalize on, with tools like IBM Watson promising to address real-world problems.
`` While there is still work to be done, advances in data discovery and management, skills training and AI explainability are driving the rate of AI adoption faster than many predicted, '' said Rob Thomas, general manager at IBM Data and AI, in a blog post accompanying the survey results.

273,How to Create a Reliable Trading Plan,"
If you are serious about becoming a successful trader, one of the most important tools that you need is a reliable trading plan. Without one, you will essentially be setting yourself up for failure and financial loss. There are quite a few reasons why you should spend a lot of time creating a trading plan. Since trading is often a mental game, a trading plan can allow you to perform at a high level without letting your emotions take control. Trading plans also help us execute on our strategy and prevent huge losses. It will take a lot of time and effort to create a trading plan that works for you, especially since every trader is different, but in the long run, it will help you make progress towards continued success.
Keep in mind that there is no perfect trading plan, the key is to work on improving your plan as you get more experience with trading it. Most beginner traders go into their first trade without a plan at all. It doesn’ t matter if they make money or lose money on their first trades, without a plan, they won’ t go far. If you are having trouble creating a trading plan or you simply don’ t know where to begin, this article is for you. Below, we are going to walk you through how to create a reliable trading plan and why it is essential for trading success.
One of the first things that you need to do in order to construct a trading plan is to figure out the strategy that works for you. That means deciding what types of stocks you want to trade, what time of the day you plan to trade, how long you will keep a trade open, and what trade catalysts you are looking to identify. Finding the setups you like and practicing your strategy are key. After you have created a strategy, you must test and tweak it with paper trading to gain confidence. If you are truly confident in your proposed strategy and have mastered its mechanics, you can move on to the next step.
document.write ( ' < a style= '' text-decoration: none; font-weight: normal; color: # 696969; '' target= ''  blank '' rel= '' nofollow '' href= '' https: //www.ame ' + 'ricanconsumernews.net/scripts/click.aspx? NativeDisplayAdID=565 & ImpressionID=0 & UserID=0 & Placement=PlaceOnArticlePage '' > '); Pro trader Alan Knuckman has been saying it for years... “ DON’ T BUY STOCKS! ” And right now could be the best time for you to listen. Luckily, Alan just released details on a brand-new opportunity for anyone savvy enough to hear him out.
A trading plan isn’ t just about setups and strategy, it’ s also about putting yourself in the best position to succeed. You need to focus on preparing yourself mentally so that you can execute each trade at a high level. Developing a solid trading routine should be the next part of your plan. Consider things like the time you wake up each day, how much time you spend analyzing charts before trading, and what your emotional state is prior to market open. Make sure you take care of the small details and put yourself in a position to win every day that you plan on trading.
Perhaps the most important part of a reliable trading plan is working through risk management. In trading, you should always think about the downside of each trade. Getting your position sizing wrong due to poor risk management will lead to huge mistakes. This is where you should really focus on risk-reward ratios, specific entry points, stop losses, profit targets, and your position size for a trade. Many traders commit to a certain percentage that they are willing to risk on each trade. Their maximum loss will never exceed that amount, which prevents them from suffering huge losses. For example, you might commit to a 2% max loss on each trade. That means your total loss on any trade will not exceed 2% of your total account value. One of the most important things to do when creating a trading plan is to think about how much you are willing to lose on a trade. Most beginner traders will instead think about how much they plan to gain. The downside risk is always present on every single trade, so don’ t neglect to include it in your trading plan.
The idea behind creating a trading plan is that when the time comes to actually execute the trade, you’ ve already done all of the hard work. Your entry and exit should already be defined so that all you need to do is trade your plan. This allows you to have better control of your mental state and avoid making any emotional mistakes. Keep in mind that once your trade is live, things change a lot. The more parameters and rules you can set up for yourself to follow before the trade goes live, the quicker you will be able to react. Always trade your plan and record your progress each day so that you can continuously refine and improve your trading plan.
We hope this article has helped you gain some valuable insight into how to create a reliable trading plan. Remember that if you don’ t have a trading plan you are confident in, don’ t trade!

10 Best Tech Stocks to Buy After the Market’ s Historic Sell-Off
Technology stocks are among the most volatile in the market. The allure of big gains comes with the risk of sharp downturns. When the market is trending upwards, these stocks have a tendency to lead the way. Conversely, when the market is selling off, tech stocks post some of the largest losses. And in the coronavirus crash tech stocks took their usual beating. But an interesting dynamic is happening. As stocks are trying to stage a comeback, many tech stocks are being left behind. Many of the leading tech stocks trade on the NASDAQ exchange. However, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average ( DJIA) and S & P 500 posted gains on March 25, the NASDAQ stayed down. And that’ s an opportunity for investors who know where to look. We’ ve put together this presentation to give you ten technology stocks that look to be solid bets no matter which way the market moves. Some of the stocks you’ ll see are companies that have a business model that is perfectly suited for today’ s social distancing environment.

677,Near Miss of the Day 362: Punishment pass while beeping horn,"Like this site? Help us to make it better.
It's impossible to interpret the driving in our latest Near Miss of the Day video as being anything other than a deliberate attempt to intimidate the cyclist.
The beeping the horn right before overtaking the cyclist is bad enough, but the fact the overtake itself takes place where the carriageway narrows due to a pedestrian island makes it clear that this is what is commonly termed a 'punishment pass '.
The footage was shot by road.cc reader Mike, who told us: `` This driver needs educating that there simply isn’ t enough space to squeeze past a cyclist while passing a pedestrian refuge island. ''
> Near Miss of the Day turns 100 - Why do we do the feature and what have we learnt from it?
Over the years road.cc has reported on literally hundreds of close passes and near misses involving badly driven vehicles from every corner of the country – so many, in fact, that we’ ve decided to turn the phenomenon into a regular feature on the site. One day hopefully we will run out of close passes and near misses to report on, but until that happy day arrives, Near Miss of the Day will keep rolling on.
If you’ ve caught on camera a close encounter of the uncomfortable kind with another road user that you’ d like to share with the wider cycling community please send it to us at info [ at ] road.cc or send us a message via the road.cc Facebook page.
If the video is on YouTube, please send us a link, if not we can add any footage you supply to our YouTube channel as an unlisted video ( so it won't show up on searches).
Please also let us know whether you contacted the police and if so what their reaction was, as well as the reaction of the vehicle operator if it was a bus, lorry or van with company markings etc.

976,China's Wuhan virus unfolds in new age of WeChat — Quartz,"When the SARS outbreak hit China in 2003, only 6% of the population had access to the internet. Seventeen years later, that number has increased tenfold: more than 61% of the Chinese population are now online, according to the latest government figures.
The daily lives of Chinese citizens today are shaped, to a large extent, by something that didn’ t even exist in 2003: WeChat. Launched in 2011, the all-encompassing app is, for many in China, the internet itself. It’ s where citizens read, chat, shop, socialize, and pay for everything from taxi rides to groceries. It’ s also a platform where the state surveils its people.
This is the backdrop against which China’ s coronavirus outbreak, which has sickened some 2,000 people ( link in Chinese) and killed nearly 60, is unfolding in 2020: hyper-connectivity and the rapid dissemination of information—and at the same time, heightened state surveillance. All of this affects how news of the current disease outbreak is shared and censored.
This year, as in the SARS era, Chinese officials appeared to downplay the seriousness of a deadly spreading virus until the facts became impossible to ignore. Chinese health authorities went in the space of a week from saying the outbreak was “ preventable and under control “ to freezing travel from more than a dozen cities—an unprecedented measure—and one that undoubtedly raised concerns that the situation was more serious than officials had earlier been letting on.
“ I can see the same pattern, ” said Rose Luqiu, an assistant journalism professor at Hong Kong Baptist University who covered SARS in 2003, when asked if she saw similarities in how the government handled the flow of information during the two outbreaks.
In the SARS crisis, despite the first case being discovered in November 2002, a “ virtual news blackout ” prevailed around the outbreak for months; when it did become public, the country admitted to having just a few cases. It wasn’ t until a feisty newspaper ( whose staff were later detained for their continued dogged reporting) broke the news and a whistleblower came forward that officials publicly acknowledged the extent of the SARS outbreak. At the time, microblog platform Weibo and messaging app WeChat were still years away, people could bypass the government and share news mainly by text message.
Now, the sheer amount of information shared every minute by internet users in China today means that it’ s impossible for the state to maintain a watertight seal on what’ s posted online.
“ The dynamics of WeChat groups in particular shape the discussion of this epidemic, ” said Hongmei Li, an associate professor of strategic communication at Miami University. “ WeChat groups are characterized by a mixture of official and nonofficial information, foreign and domestic news, and personal observations and experiences. This suggests that it is difficult for the Chinese government to control news. ”
Online, there has been a steady trickle of photos, videos, and witness accounts from overwhelmed hospitals that seem to undermine the state’ s narrative of having the situation firmly under control. Along with reports from medical personnel, some of these grassroots accounts may have played a role in authorities moving to build temporary hospitals in Wuhan. While some hashtags and posts are quickly scrubbed by censors, others—like the hashtag # Wuhan on lockdown # —are allowed to remain, showing the government’ s attempts to walk a delicate line between censorship and transparency.
“ With the two social media platforms, the worry now is not about not getting enough information, but is more about how to distinguish which piece of information is true, ” said Wilfred Wang, a lecturer in media at the University of Melbourne who researches Chinese social media. “ The way Beijing deals with the explosive amount of information is to adopt a ‘ one eye open one eye closed’ attitude toward criticisms that do not advocate collective actions or attack the central government directly. ”
Unusually, state-run papers like People’ s Daily posted about a shortage of face masks in Wuhan, which had mandated the use of the face coverings, while in an English-language report the state-run tabloid Global Times described a shortage of testing kits. The People’ s Daily post about the face mask was later deleted, the Washington Post reported.
The desire to limit information critical of Beijing can sweep up even general information shared between individuals—including outside China. Earlier this month, a timeline of developments in the coronavirus outbreak was being widely shared on WeChat but then began to be censored, according to users Quartz spoke to. Quartz on Jan. 22 tried and failed to send the image via a private chat between a user in the US and one in the UK. There was no notification to the sender that the picture had not been sent, which often happens when people try to send “ sensitive ” content on the app. However, the person in the UK never received the picture on her end. After rotating the photo, it went through.
The same day, social media platform Weibo blocked the posting of a photo of a front page of the People’ s Daily on Jan. 23, which had drawn attention for being devoted to coverage of Xi Jinping, and none of the virus. The image was blocked even though it was not accompanied by any additional commentary of the sort users shared on Twitter.
These acts of censorship chip away at the public’ s trust in the authorities—at the exact time when the state most needs it in dealing with a public health crisis. As one article in medical journal The Lancet put it, “ It is impossible to build trust while at the same time abusing it. ”
While Chinese citizens are more connected than ever before, they are aware that state’ s capacity for surveillance is also unprecedented.
“ Over the last 10 years, the government has developed a very sophisticated capacity to control information, ” said Luqiu, the journalism professor. She pointed to cybersecurity rules which took effect in 2017, as a powerful tool of control that the government did not have in their arsenal in 2003. The law tightened China’ s censorship regime, criminalizing any online posts that the Communist party deems damaging to “ national honor, ” “ disturbing economic or social order ” or contributing to the “ overthrow of the socialist system. ”
The effort to control the online discussion began as soon, or even before, the first pneumonia cases been made public, when police in Wuhan said on Jan. 1 they had arrested eight local people ( link in Chinese) for “ spreading rumors about pneumonia ” —without any clarity about the kind of information they were sharing. The Wuhan government, in its announcement, urged people “ not to create rumors, believe rumors, or spread rumors, and to build a harmonious and clear cyberspace. ”
Zhang Xinnian, a Chinese lawyer, critiqued the local government move in a post that was viewed more than five million times before it got deleted. “ The government now thinks citizens who exchange information that they can not necessarily verify are the same as those who intentionally spread rumors, this view is very chilling, ” he wrote, noting that the incident underscored the weakness inherent in China’ s political system.
Aware of the surveillance, Chinese people have developed coded ways to speak about taboo topics. On one of the more liberal corners of China’ s internet, some users vented their anger at the authorities on the review page for the TV show Chernobyl—and also shared show references on other social media platforms to compare China’ s attitude to that of the Communist Soviet Union when the nuclear disaster unfolded in 1986. Access to that page is now restricted to registered users.
Still, China seems to have gotten more media savvy over the years, too. In 2003, Zhong Nanshan, the epidemiologist helped expose the scale of the SARS outbreak, didn’ t give his first interview until April ( link in Chinese) —months after the first case of SARS was discovered in November 2002. This time, however, he spoke with state broadcaster CCTV within three weeks of of the Wuhan government reporting a cluster of pneumonia cases to the World Health Organization. Allowing such a central figure as Zhong to take an interview, said Luqiu, is a strategic way for the government to both “ raise awareness and lower panic. ”
Some health experts and officials—including Germany’ s health minister—note that China has been far more transparent this time than in 2003. On WeChat, there is even a whistleblower feature for users to notify the government of officials’ negligence and malpractice during the outbreak—though the state’ s reputation of persecuting whistleblowers could make many users wary of making a report.
Still, the public in China may also be less critical of the government than observers outside China may think, given the inherently fluid nature of a virus outbreak and worries about misinformation among a citizenry that has become more nationalistic over the years.
In recent days, as the death toll climbed, China’ s actions to contain the virus have intensified, as have communications from officials regarding the seriousness of the situation. China’ s National Health Commission deputy director Li Bin vowed last week that the government would “ disclose information on the outbreak based on facts ” in a timely manner. On Saturday ( Jan. 26), Chinese leader Xi Jinping said the outbreak was of “ grave concern ” and ordered a centralized response to tackle the epidemic.
And Chinese citizens in various provinces have set up a volunteer-run crowdsourced information and fact-checking portal ( link in Chinese) to share updates and debunk false claims. The site ends with a quote from Lu Xun, arguably the most famous Chinese writer of the modern era: “ If there is no torch after all, then you are the only light. ”
The age of connectivity has certainly empowered Chinese citizens to shine some light into an opaque system, making it much harder for the state to impose the kind of information blackout that prevailed during SARS. Whether the government will embrace the need for extreme transparency, or eventually snuff out even that little bit of light, is another question.

183,Chinese researchers reveal draft genome of virus implicated in Wuhan pneumonia outbreak,"A seafoofd market in Wuhan, China has been considered the likely source of an outbreak of a novel virus but it may have first infected people elsewhere.
By Jon CohenJan. 11, 2020, 3:00 PM
Scientists worried about China’ s lack of transparency about a month-old outbreak of pneumonia in the city of Wuhan breathed a sigh of relief today, after a consortium of researchers published a draft genome of the newly discovered coronavirus suspected of causing the outbreak.
“ Potentially really important moment in global public health-must be celebrated, everyone involved in Wuhan, in China & beyond acknowledged, thanked & get all the credit, ” Jeremy Farrar, head of the Wellcome Trust in London, wrote in a tweet. “ Sharing of data good for public health, great for those who did the work. Just needs those incentives & trust. ”
Also this morning, Wuhan health authorities reported the first death from the new disease. The patient was a 61-year-old man who frequently visited the live market in Wuhan that most cases have been linked to. He also suffered from abdominal tumors and chronic liver disease and died on Thursday. The Wuhan Health Commission said 41 people so far have been confirmed to have been infected with the new virus; no new patients have been identified since 3 January.
News about the sequence came from Edward Holmes, a virologist and evolutionary biologist at the University of Sydney, who tweeted the first notice about the availability of what he referred to as an “ initial ” sequence of the virus early this morning. Holmes is a member of a consortium led by Yong-Zhen Zhang of the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center & School of Public Health that posted the sequence on an open-access site, virological.org. The consortium said it had also deposited the sequence in GenBank. In a brief note, the group said researchers were free to analyze and share the data, but asked that groups “ communicate with us if you wish to publish results that use these data in a journal. ”
The analyzing began immediately. Evolutionary biologist Andrew Rambaut at the University of Edinburgh calculated that the virus has a 89% similarity to a severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS) -related member of the Sarbecoviruses, a subgenus within the Betacoronavirus genus.
Potentially really important moment in global public health-must be celebrated …
Kevin Olival, vice-president for research of the EcoHealth Alliance, published a phylogenetic tree on Twitter and concurred that the new virus “ definitely clusters ” with the SARS-related coronaviruses. ( Later in the day, Rambaut criticized the fact that Olival did not credit the researchers who isolated the virus and sequenced it. “ This is one of the reasons why people are reticent to share data, ” Rambaut wrote on Twitter. “ No acknowledgement of where the data comes from or who generated it. The [ phylogenetic tree ] is even branded with a logo. ”)
Ralph Baric, a coronavirus researcher at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, notes that of the four known SARS-related bat viruses capable of infecting humans, this one is the most distant from SARS itself. After downloading the sequence last night, his lab immediately began to try to reverse-engineer a live virus from the sequence, which can be helpful to develop antibody tests and to start experiments in animal models. “ If you want to have a strong public health response, you have to do this quickly, ” says Baric, who leads one of the few labs in the world that can re-create coronaviruses just from their sequences. ( Bureaucratic hurdles would make it difficult for China to ship the actual virus quickly to other countries, he says.)
Baric hopes this virus’ s discovery and the response to it illustrate the speed at which scientists can move by working together. “ One of the things that’ s sad is that the public doesn’ t realize how incredibly competent the public health and the basic science community are at going from a newly discovered virus to a tremendous amount of capacity to trace and try to control its spread, ” Baric says.

47,Трамптың соғысқа апарар соқыр маршы by Djavad Salehi-Isfahani,"Вашингтон, Колумбия округі – АҚШ президенті Дональд Трамп өз елін 2018 жылдың мамыр айында Бірлескен Кешенді Іс-қимыл Жоспарынан шығаруға шешім қабылдағанға дейін, Иран Сыртқы істер министрі және Иранның ядролық келісімнің бас сәулетшісі Джавад Зариф өз еліндегі ең танымал қоғам қайраткері болды.

Трамптың айтуынша ол Сулейманиді өлтірген дронның соққысын `` соғысты тоқтату '' үшін санкциялады. Бірақ бұл ол оны бастады немесе, кем дегенде, оған апарар жолды бастағаны әлдеқайда ықтимал.

Djavad Salehi-Isfahani cites George Orwell’ s 1946 essay “ In Front of your Nose. ” According Orwell, “ we are all capable of believing things which we know to be untrue, and then, when we are finally proved wrong, impudently twisting the facts so as to show that we were right. Intellectually, it is possible to carry on this process for an indefinite time: the only check on it is that sooner or later a false belief bumps up against solid reality, usually on a battlefield. '' This may seem especially relevant right now, as we survey Trump’ s order to kill Iran’ s second most powerful man. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo may have walked back just how “ imminent ” a threat Qassem Suleimani posed. Rather than shed new light, he opted to talk about what Suleimani had already done, before adding that the slain general’ s campaigns could “ lead potentially to the death of many more Americans. ” Even chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Mark Milley, was unambiguous: “ I will stand by the intelligence I saw, ” he said. “ That was compelling. It was imminent. It was very, very clear in scale, scope. ” Defense Secretary Mark Esper said the threat was “ a matter days, certainly no more than weeks. ” The Trump administration has a credibility problem, and Pompeo is part of it. He has a history replete with bending the facts to suit his boss, Trump, who claimed the killing of Suleimani was “ to stop a war, ” while in reality he may well be starting one himself.The author also maintains the Trump administration has underestimated Iran’ s strength and misjudged the outcome of unilaterally abandoning the 2015 deal that Tehran signed with world powers. It imposed stringent sanctions that aim to cripple Iran’ s economy and trigger an implosion. Based on “ false assumptions ” Trump and his hawkish advisers, like Pompeo, thought the “ poverty-stricken Iranian public would reject hardliners like Suleimani and support the rise of a new leadership cadre that would bring peace and stability to the region. ” Overconfident, Trump and his hawks apparently have not anticipated that “ two years after the resumption of sanctions, Iran’ s economy would be showing signs of recovery. And yet, during the third quarter of 2019, employment rose by 3.3% year on year, and unemployment declined to a seven-year low. ” The author used raw data for the labour force survey of Iran ( LFS), which – following the ILO guidelines – are all available on the SCI’ s data portal. These figures do cast doubt on IMF’ s “ grim forecast ” for Iran’ s economy. The author debunks the myth “ that Iran’ s hardliners are holding onto power by sheer force. ” But the widespread support for Suleimani, and another hardliner: Ebrahim Raisi, who heads Iran’ s judiciary, arose following Iranians’ disappointment with moderates like Foreign Ministerr Mohammed Javad Zarif and President Hassan Rouhani, whose nuclear deal in 2015 failed to fulfil their dream of peace and prosperity, even though “ they were powerless to stop the US from reneging on it. ” In the absence of economic stability, many rallied behind Suleimani, who had defended Iran against Sadddam Hussein in the 1980s and ISIS in recent years. The author says Iranians have no appetite for “ US-sponsored ” regime change, having learned a lesson from the chaos in the region – Iraq, Libya and Yemen. This will motivate them to stay out of an all-out war with its adversaries – the US, Israel and Saudi Arabia.
The pattern of actions is unmistakable - the Trump administration is actively looking for a fight. It is not a blind march to war, as the headline suggests, it is deliberate.There is some confluence of interests within the US government. The administration has been partially purged of Obama era staffers, who wasted their opportunity to resign on impeachment related matters. Any `` hesitation '' regarding Iran is, unfortunately in this context, associated with Obama era national security staff, and is not likely to be taken seriously.Besides this, Pompeo and some of his colleagues are devout religious believers. Although this would in an abstract sense create common ground with their sworn enemies, the state of mind is not helpful in avoiding armed conflict. They are also devout believers in the toxic and unrealistic Bush era narratives of power projection, regime change, what they see as strategic gamesmanship, and the glory of world primacy.They inherit the institutional workings of the better organized Bush and Obama administrations. Namely, blank-check AUMF's, Patriot Act, and Obama-era drone wars. With these already in place, they can write a few check-the-boxes type memos, and the structure set up for them by predecessors goes to work. This allows them to act with little oversight. This is why Abuse of Power is inherent in such governmental structures. It will be the same with the next person to take Trump's place.Although we are hearing some noises about congressional oversight, the basic fact is that Democratic `` opposition '', especially in the Senate, is hawkish on Iran, and scared to death of crossing the national security people or losing the funding of their business partners. Nearly all of Congress was happy to approve of legislation related to the so-called war on terror, like Patriot act and its companions, without even bothering to read the legislation.Most of the operators of Washington's foreign-policy-consensus share the Trump administration's fundamental belief: that anyone defying worldwide US power must be an enemy, that a combination of air power and mercenaries can accomplish noble goals, and that if they try hard enough, success will restore the reputation of the US. Lastly, it is also possible that the Trump administration will see the conflict as an opportunity to mend its strained relationship with factions of the broader policy making world who criticized Trump for other reasons, but ultimately out of political necessity.
It may sound somewhat an incongruous statement here! Why in the world, Iranians were run over by and lost Iranian soul to Arab invasions, a long time ago.

Forecasting inflation is a staple of macroeconomic modeling, yet virtually all economists’ predictions for the United States in 2021 were way off the mark. This dismal performance reflected a collective failure to take economic models seriously enough, as well as other analytical shortcomings.
When the COVID-19 pandemic ends, the world will need a new governance model that differs from its predecessors in several fundamental respects. In particular, while finance, economics, and business remain vitally important, they must serve society and nature – not the other way around.

But low rates also mean that people are staying in their homes longer. “ Falling mortgage rates can help incentivize homeowners to sell their home and purchase a different home, but persistently low mortgage rates can have the opposite effect, ” wrote First American chief economist Mark Fleming.
Because many existing homeowners either bought property when rates were low or took advantage of the recent dip in rates to refinance, they are now sitting comfortably with historically affordable mortgages. That could make them less likely to move because it’ s unlikely they’ d see much financial benefits in the form of a cheaper mortgage, meaning the choice to move will be driven by other factors such as higher income or an expanding family.

The restructuring of global supply chains has accelerated as a result. Looking ahead there’ s a mixture of short- and long-timeframe risks and opportunities to consider.
Come for the Commitments, Stay for the Enforcement – Trade War Show Season 4 BeginsWhat is the U.S. committing to? What’ s China committing to? What’ s the impact on supply chains?
This digital report showcases views from S & P Global Platts Analytics on key trends that will unfold in sectors such as oil, gas, power, coal, petrochemicals and agriculture. The interactive timeline allows you to explore the news events that will shape 2020, while S & P Global Platts president Martin Fraenkel also talks through his five commodity themes to watch.
S & P Global Platts President Martin Fraenkel lays out his five themes to focus on in commodity markets in 2020. The landscape for commodity markets is marked by geopolitical tensions and macroeconomic concerns, rangebound commodity prices and rising consumer awareness of climate change. As we look ahead to 2020, we think the year will bring some of these themes into even sharper focus.
Despite concerns over slowing global macroeconomic growth, 2019 was an active year in the structured finance markets, with over $ 1.1 trillion issued across the globe, up nearly 10% on a year-over-year basis. By country/region, the U.S., China, Australia, and Latin America all printed higher new issue volumes, while Europe, Japan, and Canada were down modestly. Looking into 2020, our baseline macroeconomic view is broadly neutral, but with risks weighted to the downside -- a precarious balance. Some factors that could have knock-on effects for structured finance credit and issuance are global trade-related tensions, continued Brexit uncertainty, an unforeseen increase in interest rates, and market volatility that negatively affects liquidity. That said, our baseline view is still for global macroeconomic growth and relatively low ( historically speaking) interest rates. As such, we expect 2020 issuance volume to remain in the $ 1 trillion neighborhood, with all covered countries/regions posting totals close to their 2019 volumes. On the credit side, we generally expect stability, albeit with pockets of weakness in some sectors and regions.
As the new decade begins, U.S. state credit is generally strong. Possibly nearing the end of the longest economic expansion in modern history, states are delicately balancing service delivery costs, building reserves, and mitigating future risks like climate change. This balancing act is occurring during a time of growing fixed-cost obligations and a pace of economic growth likely to remain below that seen in past expansionary periods. The shallow nature of this economic expansion has led to narrow fiscal margins for many states, but for fiscal 2019 state revenues came in higher than in fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2020 revenue projections remain positive. State officials are adjusting expenditure needs within the slower growing revenue-generating environment leading to this stability. Even though states are adjusting to the lower-for-longer economy and generating favorable results, some credit challenges remain and others are emerging. Management continues to play a critical role in maintaining balanced operations and credit stability.

966,China says coronavirus can spread before symptoms show -- calling into question US containment strategy,"
China's health minister Ma Xiaowei made a startling statement Sunday about the Wuhan coronavirus: He said people can spread it before they become symptomatic.
`` This is a game changer, '' said Dr. William Schaffner, a longtime adviser to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
It's much harder to contain a virus -- to track down a patient's contacts and quarantine them immediately -- if the patient was spreading the disease for days or weeks before they even realized they had it.
Third US case of coronavirus confirmed as China warns people can spread the virus before realizing they're ill
`` It means the infection is much more contagious than we originally thought, '' said Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. `` This is worse than we anticipated. ''
Ma didn't explain why he thinks the virus can be spread before someone has symptoms. If the Chinese health minister is right -- and there are those who doubt him -- that means the five confirmed cases in the United States might have been infectious while traveling from Wuhan to Arizona, California, Illinois and Washington state, even if they had no symptoms at the time.

On Sunday, Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said the risk to the American public for contracting this virus continues to be low.
`` We at CDC don't have clear evidence that patients are infectious before symptom onset, but we are actively investigating that possibility, '' Messonnier said.
`` We need to be preparing as if this is a pandemic, but I continue to hope that it is not, '' she added.
The Wuhan coronavirus has killed more than 50 people in China and infected thousands there, and spread as far as the US, France and Canada.
'We're going to have to reevaluate our strategy '
US health officials believe the Wuhan virus has an incubation period of about two weeks, CDC officials said Friday during a media briefing.
American trapped at the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak says she's angry and scared
`` Based on what we know now about this virus, our concern for transmission before symptoms develop is low, so that is reassuring, '' Dr. Jennifer Layden, an epidemiologist with the Illinois Department of Health, said at the Friday briefing.
The update on Sunday from the Chinese health minister should encourage health officials to change that thinking, some infectious disease experts told CNN.
`` Assuming that Ma is correct, we're going to have to re-evaluate our strategy, that's for sure, '' Schaffner said.
Dr. Paul Offit, another longtime CDC adviser, said given Ma's news, he thinks health officials should alert people on the flights that the three US patients took from Wuhan that they might have traveled with someone who was infectious.
`` I think the conservative thing to do would be to cast a wider net, '' he said.
NIH doctor wants US to inspect Chinese data
The United States ' top infectious disease doctor wants a team of CDC disease detectives to go to China and check on these crucial questions about how the Wuhan coronavirus is spreading.
But there's something stopping them: China first has to invite the CDC.
`` Up to now, to my knowledge, we have not been invited, '' Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the US National Institutes of Health, said Sunday.
NIH and CDC are separate divisions of the US Department of Health and Human Services.
The implications of Ma's statement that the coronavirus is transmissible before symptoms are so important `` that in my mind it's absolutely critical that we ourselves see the data, because what goes on over there has implications for what happens here, '' Fauci said.
A visual guide to the Wuhan coronavirus
He added that to his knowledge, the Chinese did not tell US health authorities that the virus could spread before someone is symptomatic, a crucial aspect of any disease investigation. He said he learned about it after reading a CNN reporter's email.
Fauci said that CDC disease detectives would need to see precisely how Chinese health authorities have gathered their data and how they came to their conclusion.
`` To my knowledge, we have not seen the precise minute, granular data and how they collected it, '' he said. `` We need to get to the real bottom line of how they collected their data and see if it's valid. ''
`` The Chinese have good people. I don't want to impugn their capabilities, '' Fauci added. `` But when it's something as important as this, our people who are trained epidemiologists need to go over their data and the best way to do that is go there and see how they're collecting it. ''
CDC's Messonnier said Sunday the CDC has staff in China, but the team is not directly involved in the Wuhan coronavirus response. The agency hopes to have `` additional engagement '' on the outbreak in China in the coming days, she said.
In a tweet on Sunday, World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said, `` I am on my way to Beijing, [ China ] to meet with the Government & health experts supporting the # coronavirus response. My @ WHO colleagues & I would like to understand the latest developments & strengthen our partnership with [ China ] in providing further protection against the outbreak. ''
Are Chinese officials right?
In a fast-spreading, evolving outbreak like this one, information often changes.
Wuhan coronavirus death toll rises to 56 as healthcare workers say medical supplies are running out
Some experts are skeptical because of the lack of data from China.
`` I seriously doubt that the Chinese public officials have any data supporting this statement, '' said Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. `` I know of no evidence in 17 years of working with coronaviruses -- SARS and MERS -- where anyone has been found to be infectious during their incubation period. ''
Severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome are both caused by coronaviruses. While each has killed hundreds of people worldwide, together they amounted to only a handful of cases and no deaths in the United States.
Offit, on the other hand, said it wouldn't surprise him if the Chinese health minister is right and the Wuhan coronavirus can be spread while people are asymptomatic. Measles, mumps, rubella and chicken pox all spread that way, he said.
Despite that, he said he's optimistic that the US can control the outbreak before it gets out of hand, as it has in China.
That's because the spread of the outbreak doesn't just rely on the time period of contagiousness. It also relies on how easily the virus spreads. Some viruses, such as measles, spread easily even to people on the other side of a room. Other viruses spread only with much closer contact.

870,下一个发展大挑战 by Arvind Subramanian & Josh Felman,"坎布里奇—突然间，我们来到了全球经济发展的微妙阶段。在经历了令人瞩目的三十年增长、迅速赶超发达经济体之后，新兴市场正在失去活力。此外，重燃活力需要新的经济战略。但这一模式从哪里去找，谁又能提供理论领导？
国际货币基金组织（IMF）和世界银行的最新经济预测令人警醒，它们表明，中国、印度、撒哈拉以南非洲和拉丁美洲无不将陷入长期减速。当然，关于 “ 增长的终结 ” 的警告可能像过去的新兴市场崛起不可阻挡的说法一样，有些过于夸张。但发展中国家的决策者真的忧心忡忡，正在绞尽脑汁思考如何复苏日颓的活力。
在过去，政府有一个现成的理论方案：所谓的华盛顿共识。这一术语由彼得森国际经济学研究所的约翰·威廉姆森（John Williamson）提出，其鼓吹一套总体战略，包括宏观经济稳定、私有化、去监管化和全球化。

Great papers. But how can you help Discrimination in economic growth? Poor pays 18% GST when he eats at restaurants. But wealth accumulated from $ 2T economy, 90% wealth owners/riches pay 3% GST on gold jewelry. And the Discrimination list goes on and on.... Will economists address these or someone like new godly-Economist needs to be reborn in the world?
`` protracted slowdowns across the board in China ''??? Hardly! China's economic growth was bigger last year than ever in its history or, for that matter, in world history. GDP growth was 9.4 percent a decade ago, but the base for last year’ s estimated 6.1 percent was 188 percent larger than the base 10 yrs ago. So the incremental expansion in the size of China’ s economy in 2019 was 151 percent bigger than it was at the faster growth rate 10 yrs ago.It is sad indeed that a former Chief Economist is unaware of this simple fact.

The world will enter 2022 still grappling with the COVID-19 pandemic, climate change, geopolitical tensions, and economic uncertainty. Developing effective policy responses to these challenges is essential to passing the biggest global test of all: rekindling a sense of public trust and optimism.
Although major economies and markets fared well in 2021 despite all of the uncertainties surrounding new variants of the coronavirus, 2022 will bring new challenges. In addition to central banks shifting toward policy normalization, geopolitical and systemic risks are multiplying.

861,The Next Big Development Challenge by Arvind Subramanian & Josh Felman,"New strategies for reviving growth in emerging markets will have to be indigenous, rather than coming from Western institutions. But where will such strategies come from, and who will provide the intellectual leadership?
CAMBRIDGE – We have suddenly arrived at a tricky stage in global economic development. Emerging markets are losing their dynamism, after a remarkable three-decade-long run during which they caught up rapidly with advanced economies. Moreover, rekindling this vigor requires a new economic strategy. But where will such a model come from, and who will provide the intellectual leadership?
The latest economic forecasts from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank are sobering, pointing to protracted slowdowns across the board in China, India, Sub-Saharan Africa, and Latin America. Of course, alarmism about the “ end of growth ” might be as overblown as past hype about emerging markets’ unstoppable rise. But policymakers in developing countries are genuinely concerned and are grappling with how to revive flagging dynamism.
In the past, governments had a ready intellectual solution: the so-called Washington Consensus, a term coined by John Williamson of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, which advocated a broad strategy of macroeconomic stabilization, privatization, deregulation, and globalization.

611,Davos 2020: Business leaders worried about coronavirus from China,"DAVOS, Switzerland — Leaders of American businesses attending the World Economic Forum have privately expressed concerns about the coronavirus, which has killed more than a dozen people in China.
Several of these executives, who have investments in China, said on Wednesday that they are concerned about the virus spreading beyond China's rural areas and into heavily populated cities, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter. These people declined to be named because they didn't want to cause alarm.
The virus, which has sickened at least 440 people and killed 17 in China, has already spread into Beijing, Shanghai and Macau. Beyond China, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently confirmed one case of the virus making its way to the U.S.
Some business leaders raised these concerns directly with President Donald Trump during a breakfast Wednesday morning, according to an executive at the gathering who declined to be named because the event was private.
Trump brushed aside those concerns, according to the executive, echoing comments he made earlier in the day, during an interview with CNBC's Joe Kernen that aired on `` Squawk Box. '' The president said in the interview that he trusted China's President Xi Jinping's handling of the virus and said the U.S. has it `` totally under control. ''
A White House spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.
The discussions in Davos have focused, in part, on the impact the virus could have on the livelihoods of the citizens of China and people around the world if it turned into a pandemic, the people said. The talks also covered how leaders would manage their businesses amid the upcoming Chinese New Year celebrations and beyond. The holiday is one of the busiest travel days in China.
Many companies, including big financial institutions J.P. Morgan, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley and Bank of America, have offices in China and employ thousands of people there. While these American banks have yet to issue any warnings about the virus, a Europe-based financial institution has issued guidance to its staff as the virus spreads, according to a person at the bank participating in the World Economic Forum. This executive declined to be named or disclose the name of the bank issuing the guidance, given the sensitivity of the matter.
`` We are advising staff to be aware of the situation, close monitoring is in place, and staff health and safety is our top priority, '' the bank executive said.
Some business leaders have said publicly that the spread of the virus could hurt stocks.
`` We 've got a curveball with this coronavirus. I think that's a big deal. If you look at what happened in 2003, estimates ranged 0.5% to 2% in GDP for China, half a percent for Southeast Asia, '' investor Paul Tudor Jones told CNBC's `` Squawk Box '' from the World Economic Forum.
U.S. business executives at the conference have been hearing privately from their Chinese counterparts that the outbreak could become equivalent to that of SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, which originated in China in 2002. That virus led to more than 700 deaths. Some analysts have said the virus does not appear to be as lethal as SARS.
Not everyone in Davos is raising a red flag about the coronavirus. A medical industry executive, who declined to be named because their company sessions are private, said they had not started holding deliberations about it because they believe the virus is mostly contained in rural areas.
But Scott Gottlieb, the former commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, told CNBC in a phone interview on Wednesday that the unknown aspects of the virus could create fear, especially if it turns into an epidemic.
`` It appears, based on the limiting information we have now, that for most people it should only cause a mild or moderate illness, '' Gottlieb said. `` But there's a lot we don't know, and even a mild illness, if it's novel and becomes epidemic, can create a lot of fear and uncertainty. ''

444,This is how far and fast the coronavirus has spread through U.S. stocks,"Fears of a potential coronavirus pandemic has weighed heavily on shares of companies in a wide variety of sectors this week, particularly those with revenue exposure to travel into and out of China.
With the death toll reaching 6, and with more than 300 having been infected by the virus, the Chinese government confirmed over the long weekend that the virus can be spread by humans. That sparked fears of a pandemic similar to that of SARS ( severe acute respiratory syndrome), another coronavirus that spread from China to more than a dozen countries in 2003 and killed about 800 people.
As airports in several countries increased biosecurity screenings of passengers from China, travel-related stocks were hit hard, especially considering how travel could be curtailed during the upcoming Lunar New Year travel season.

559,Moderna is working on a vaccine for China's deadly coronavirus,"Moderna on Tuesday told CNBC it is working with U.S. government health agencies to develop a vaccine for the current strain of coronavirus that has killed nine and infected hundreds more in China.
Shares of Moderna surged 7% in premarket trading following the report.
The biotech company is working with the National Institutes of Health ( NIH), the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases ( NIAID), and the Vaccine Research Center ( VRC) on a potential vaccine, the company said in a Securities and Exchange filing.
Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel told CNBC's Becky Quick his company is working with the NIH to develop the vaccine. `` They 've produced a cancer vaccine in 40 days; using the same tech to do this quickly, '' Quick tweeted.

`` Moderna's mRNA vaccine technology could serve as a rapid and flexible platform that may be useful in responding to newly emerging viral threats, such as the novel coronavirus, '' the company said in its SEC filing. `` While we have not previously tested this rapid response capability, Moderna confirms that we are working with NIH/NIAID/VRC on a potential vaccine response to the current public health emergency. ''
Moderna, founded in 2010, is using Amazon's cloud platform for more than a dozen drug candidates in the pipeline, with seven going through trial studies, according to Amazon Web Services. The cloud service is used to help speed up the amount of time it takes to get the drugs from research to clinical trials.
