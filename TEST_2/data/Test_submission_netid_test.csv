17910,17911,The Statistical Recurrent Unit,"  Sophisticated gated recurrent neural network architectures like LSTMs and
GRUs have been shown to be highly effective in a myriad of applications. We
develop an un-gated unit, the statistical recurrent unit (SRU), that is able to
learn long term dependencies in data by only keeping moving averages of
statistics. The SRU's architecture is simple, un-gated, and contains a
comparable number of parameters to LSTMs; yet, SRUs perform favorably to more
sophisticated LSTM and GRU alternatives, often outperforming one or both in
various tasks. We show the efficacy of SRUs as compared to LSTMs and GRUs in an
unbiased manner by optimizing respective architectures' hyperparameters in a
Bayesian optimization scheme for both synthetic and real-world tasks.

3892,3893,Stochastic population dynamics in spatially extended predator-prey systems,"  Spatially extended population dynamics models that incorporate intrinsic
noise serve as case studies for the role of fluctuations and correlations in
biological systems. Including spatial structure and stochastic noise in
predator-prey competition invalidates the deterministic Lotka-Volterra picture
of neutral population cycles. Stochastic models yield long-lived erratic
population oscillations stemming from a resonant amplification mechanism. In
spatially extended predator-prey systems, one observes noise-stabilized
activity and persistent correlations. Fluctuation-induced renormalizations of
the oscillation parameters can be analyzed perturbatively. The critical
dynamics and the non-equilibrium relaxation kinetics at the predator extinction
threshold are characterized by the directed percolation universality class.
Spatial or environmental variability results in more localized patches which
enhances both species densities. Affixing variable rates to individual
particles and allowing for trait inheritance subject to mutations induces fast
evolutionary dynamics for the rate distributions. Stochastic spatial variants
of cyclic competition with rock-paper-scissors interactions illustrate
connections between population dynamics and evolutionary game theory, and
demonstrate how space can help maintain diversity. In two dimensions,
three-species cyclic competition models of the May-Leonard type are
characterized by the emergence of spiral patterns whose properties are
elucidated by a mapping onto a complex Ginzburg-Landau equation. Extensions to
general food networks can be classified on the mean-field level, which provides
both a fundamental understanding of ensuing cooperativity and emergence of
alliances. Novel space-time patterns emerge as a result of the formation of
competing alliances, such as coarsening domains that each incorporate
rock-paper-scissors competition games.

11720,11721,Merlin-Arthur with efficient quantum Merlin and quantum supremacy for the second level of the Fourier hierarchy,"  We introduce a simple sub-universal quantum computing model, which we call
the Hadamard-classical circuit with one-qubit (HC1Q) model. It consists of a
classical reversible circuit sandwiched by two layers of Hadamard gates, and
therefore it is in the second level of the Fourier hierarchy. We show that
output probability distributions of the HC1Q model cannot be classically
efficiently sampled within a multiplicative error unless the polynomial-time
hierarchy collapses to the second level. The proof technique is different from
those used for previous sub-universal models, such as IQP, Boson Sampling, and
DQC1, and therefore the technique itself might be useful for finding other
sub-universal models that are hard to classically simulate. We also study the
classical verification of quantum computing in the second level of the Fourier
hierarchy. To this end, we define a promise problem, which we call the
probability distribution distinguishability with maximum norm (PDD-Max). It is
a promise problem to decide whether output probability distributions of two
quantum circuits are far apart or close. We show that PDD-Max is BQP-complete,
but if the two circuits are restricted to some types in the second level of the
Fourier hierarchy, such as the HC1Q model or the IQP model, PDD-Max has a
Merlin-Arthur system with quantum polynomial-time Merlin and classical
probabilistic polynomial-time Arthur.

6172,6173,Distribution of the periodic points of the Farey map,"  We expand the cross section of the geodesic flow in the tangent bundle of the
modular surface given by Series to produce another section whose return map
under the geodesic flow is a double cover of the natural extension of the Farey
map. We use this cross section to extend the correspondence between the closed
geodesics on the modular surface and the periodic points of the Gauss map to
include the periodic points of the Farey map. Then, analogous to the work of
Pollicott, we prove an equidistribution result for the periodic points of the
Farey map when they are ordered according to the length of their corresponding
closed geodesics.

8155,8156,Learning model-based planning from scratch,"  Conventional wisdom holds that model-based planning is a powerful approach to
sequential decision-making. It is often very challenging in practice, however,
because while a model can be used to evaluate a plan, it does not prescribe how
to construct a plan. Here we introduce the ""Imagination-based Planner"", the
first model-based, sequential decision-making agent that can learn to
construct, evaluate, and execute plans. Before any action, it can perform a
variable number of imagination steps, which involve proposing an imagined
action and evaluating it with its model-based imagination. All imagined actions
and outcomes are aggregated, iteratively, into a ""plan context"" which
conditions future real and imagined actions. The agent can even decide how to
imagine: testing out alternative imagined actions, chaining sequences of
actions together, or building a more complex ""imagination tree"" by navigating
flexibly among the previously imagined states using a learned policy. And our
agent can learn to plan economically, jointly optimizing for external rewards
and computational costs associated with using its imagination. We show that our
architecture can learn to solve a challenging continuous control problem, and
also learn elaborate planning strategies in a discrete maze-solving task. Our
work opens a new direction toward learning the components of a model-based
planning system and how to use them.

2957,2958,Photographic dataset: playing cards,"  This is a photographic dataset collected for testing image processing
algorithms. The idea is to have images that can exploit the properties of total
variation, therefore a set of playing cards was distributed on the scene. The
dataset is made available at www.fips.fi/photographic_dataset2.php

6820,6821,A critical analysis of resampling strategies for the regularized particle filter,"  We analyze the performance of different resampling strategies for the
regularized particle filter regarding parameter estimation. We show in
particular, building on analytical insight obtained in the linear Gaussian
case, that resampling systematically can prevent the filtered density from
converging towards the true posterior distribution. We discuss several means to
overcome this limitation, including kernel bandwidth modulation, and provide
evidence that the resulting particle filter clearly outperforms traditional
bootstrap particle filters. Our results are supported by numerical simulations
on a linear textbook example, the logistic map and a non-linear plant growth
model.

4925,4926,Second order necessary and sufficient optimality conditions for singular solutions of partially-affine control problems,"  In this article we study optimal control problems for systems that are affine
with respect to some of the control variables and nonlinear in relation to the
others. We consider finitely many equality and inequality constraints on the
initial and final values of the state. We investigate singular optimal
solutions for this class of problems, for which we obtain second order
necessary and sufficient conditions for weak optimality in integral form. We
also derive Goh pointwise necessary optimality conditions. We show an example
to illustrate the results.

735,736,Mixing of odd- and even-frequency pairings in strongly correlated electron systems under magnetic field,"  Even- and odd-frequency superconductivity coexist due to broken time-reversal
symmetry under magnetic field. In order to describe this mixing, we extend the
linearized Eliashberg equation for the spin and charge fluctuation mechanism in
strongly correlated electron systems. We apply this extended Eliashberg
equation to the odd-frequency superconductivity on a quasi-one-dimensional
isosceles triangular lattice under in-plane magnetic field and examine the
effect of the even-frequency component.

3130,3131,New goodness-of-fit diagnostics for conditional discrete response models,"  This paper proposes new specification tests for conditional models with
discrete responses, which are key to apply efficient maximum likelihood
methods, to obtain consistent estimates of partial effects and to get
appropriate predictions of the probability of future events. In particular, we
test the static and dynamic ordered choice model specifications and can cover
infinite support distributions for e.g. count data. The traditional approach
for specification testing of discrete response models is based on probability
integral transforms of a jittered discrete data which leads to continuous
uniform iid series under the true conditional distribution. Then, standard
specification testing techniques for continuous variables could be applied to
the transformed series, but the extra randomness from jitters affects the power
properties of these methods. We investigate in this paper an alternative
transformation based only on original discrete data that avoids any
randomization. We analyze the asymptotic properties of goodness-of-fit tests
based on this new transformation and explore the properties in finite samples
of a bootstrap algorithm to approximate the critical values of test statistics
which are model and parameter dependent. We show analytically and in
simulations that our approach dominates the methods based on randomization in
terms of power. We apply the new tests to models of the monetary policy
conducted by the Federal Reserve.
