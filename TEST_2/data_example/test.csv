9,Fired British vegan files landmark discrimination case,"Hi, what are you looking for?
By
Published
A British employment tribunal began a landmark hearing Thursday on whether a strict form of veganism is a philosophical belief that must be protected in law.
Jordi Casamitjana says he was fired from an animal welfare charity for raising concerns about its pension fund's alleged investment in companies that use animal testing.
The League Against Cruel Sports -- a group that wants to ban fox and other forms of recreational hunting in Britain -- says he was dismissed for gross misconduct.
The case being heard by the employment tribunal in the eastern England city of Norwich on Thursday and Friday will determine whether ethical veganism is a `` philosophical or religious belief ''.
Ethical vegans and moral vegetarians not only follow a vegan diet but also exclude animal-derived products such as wool and leather from their daily lives.
They also try to abstain from using items such as cosmetics that underwent animal testing first.
`` This case, if successful, will establish that the belief entitles ethical vegans to protection from discrimination, '' Casamitjana's lawyer Peter Daly said in a statement.
Britain's 2010 Equality Act says a `` philosophical belief '' must be genuine `` and not an opinion or viewpoint based on the present state of information available ''.
The League Against Cruel Sports said it was not contesting that ethical veganism should be protected.
A separate hearing into the circumstances of Casamitjana's dismissal will be held at a later date.
`` As this is a hearing to decide whether veganism should be a protected status, something which the League does not contest, it would be inappropriate for us to comment further, '' a spokeswoman for the group said.

11,Medicinal cannabis substitute can treat Parkinson's disease,"Hi, what are you looking for?
By
Published
Australian researchers have demonstrated experimentally that a medication called HU-308 can lower involuntary movements termed dyskinesias, which are a side effect following years of treatment for Parkinson’ s disease. Dyskinesia covers twitches, jerking, twisting or simple restlessness but not tremor.
So far the benefits for the drug have been shown only in mice; however, the results are sufficiently positive as to signal the need for human trials. In mice HU-308 functions is as effective as another drug called amantadine, which is the only available treatment for dyskinesias ( other than cannabis). In addition, the combination of HU-308 with amantadine turned out to be even more effective compared with either drug used alone.
READ MORE: Virtual reality assists with the treatment of Parkinson’ s disease
According to lead researcher Professor Bryce Vissel ( University of Technology Sydney): “ Our study suggests that a derivative of HU-308, either alone or in combination with amantadine, may be a more effective treatment for dyskinesias and a much better option than using an unproven potentially harmful substance like cannabis. ”
The researcher cautions that not only does cannabis cause a ‘ high’ ( unwanted by many in this context), cannabis causes various effects, some of which are not beneficial in Parkinson’ s disease.
Where cannabis works on two brain receptors – CB1 and CB2 ( CB1 causes the psychoactive effect), the drug HU-308 only works on CB2.
The research has been published in the journal Neurobiology of Disease. The peer-reviewed research paper is called “ Targeting the cannabinoid receptor CB2 in a mouse model of l-dopa induced dyskinesia. ”

36,UNICEF’ s New Year appeal for Syria: cease fighting in the northwest and end the nine-year war,"NEW YORK, 2 January 2020 – “ As a new year begins and the war in Syria approaches its tenth year, the situation for many children – especially in the northwest of the country – remains dire.
“ Indeed, just yesterday, five children, aged between 6 and 13-years-old, were killed when rockets hit a primary school in Sarmin, Idlib Governorate.
“ New Year’ s Day is supposed to be a day of hope and a time to look forward to the year ahead. For families in Syria, any hope is all too often extinguished by heart-breaking violence. “ Each day, nearly 4,500 children are forced to flee their homes, with many having been displaced multiple times already. At least 140,000 children have been displaced in the past three weeks alone because of heavy violence in and around Idlib in the northwest. “ Attacks on basic civilian infrastructure providing services for children like schools and hospitals have become all too common. In 2019, the UN verified 145 attacks on schools and 82 attacks on hospitals and medical staff. More than 90 per cent of these attacks were in the northwest including in Idlib. “ Brutal winter weather – including recent storms, heavy rains and plunging temperatures – have made conditions on the ground even more gruelling for children and families, particularly for those fleeing heavy violence or living in camps. “ UNICEF is on the ground in Syria, working to keep children alive amidst the violence, chaos and cold, despite restrictions to our humanitarian access. In the northwest, together with our partners we are reaching children with winter clothes and blankets, clean drinking water, waste management services, health consultations and education and psychosocial support to help children overcome the shocks they have endured. “ While these efforts are lifesaving, they are not enough. Only an end to the war can bring Syria’ s children the safety they need and deserve. Until that time, their right to a peaceful present and hopeful future will go unfulfilled. “ As a new year begins, we issue this appeal on behalf of millions of children in Syria. We call on those fighting, especially in the northwest, and those with influence over them for the following:
· Stop all attacks on children and services that provide for them including health and education facilities and water systems.
· Reach an immediate cessation of hostilities in the northwest of Syria to first and foremost protect children, resume efforts to reach a peaceful agreement and end the war in Syria once and for all.
· Renew Security Council Resolutions that facilitate sustained and unhindered humanitarian access to all children in need in the northwest and elsewhere in Syria through all modalities possible including across the lines of control inside Syria or across its borders.
“ It is my most heartfelt hope that 2020 will – finally – be a year of peace for Syria’ s children. ”
UNICEF works in some of the world’ s toughest places, to reach the world’ s most disadvantaged children. Across more than 190 countries and territories, we work for every child, everywhere, to build a better world for everyone.

43,Accelerating the communications highway with structured light,"Hi, what are you looking for?
By
Published
The new research involves optimizing quantum mechanics ( science dealing with the behavior of matter and light) through using patterns of light in order to create an alphabet which can be leveraged to create a fast, efficient and secure light-based quantum network. By working with structured light in quantum protocols, a research team have developed a complex encoding alphabet with more information being carried per photon.
As lead researcher Dr. Andrew Forbes says: “ Light comes in a variety of patterns that can be made unique — like our faces. ” This is based on the fact that as patterns of light can be distinguished from each other, these forms can be used as a type of alphabet.
The use of light in this way creates a means of communication whereby security is more robust, and the interference to noise ( like background light fluctuations) is considerably reduced. With the communications element, this is undertaken between nodes, made possible through quantum key distribution protocols.


The nodes are necessary in order to both generate and detect photons entangled in differing patterns ( with individual patterns representing individual codes of the alphabet).
The study forms part of a wider investigation into photonic quantum states, where the harnessing quantum states and entangled states, is being considered for quantum inspired sensing, metrology, imaging, computation, as well as for communication.
The research has been published in the journal Quantum Science, where the research paper is titled “ Quantum mechanics with patterns of light: Progress in high dimensional and multidimensional entanglement with structured light. ”

53,Switzerland grapples with assisted suicide for prisoners,"Hi, what are you looking for?
By
Published
A request by a convict behind bars for life is testing Switzerland's support for assisted suicide, raising complex questions over whether ill prisoners can seek help to end their own lives.
The unprecedented case has exposed a legal vacuum in the country which has long been at the forefront of the global right-to-die debate and an official decision is due in the coming months.
`` It is natural that one would rather commit suicide than be buried alive for years to come, '' prisoner Peter Vogt said, in a written response to questions submitted by AFP.
The 69-year-old, convicted for sexual assault and rape against multiple girls and women ranging in age from 10 to 56, says he is suffering from serious kidney and heart conditions, among other ailments.
He has also been diagnosed with several psychological disorders.
Although Vogt's most recent sentence was a 10-year term handed down in 1996, he is imprisoned for life at Bostadel prison in northern Switzerland as he is still considered dangerous.
This follows a decision in 2004 when Swiss voters approved a popular initiative allowing the indefinite detention of people with established sexual delinquencies who posed a public risk.
The authorities have repeatedly determined that Vogt remains a threat despite years of treatment.
`` It would be better to be dead than to be left to vegetate behind these walls, '' he said.
In July 2018, Vogt contacted Exit Switzerland, an organisation that supports assisted suicide under specific conditions. He argues that he should be able to benefit from Switzerland's liberal assisted suicide laws too.
`` We told him that his particular case needed to be clarified, '' Juerg Wiler, its vice president, told AFP.
- 'Unbearable suffering ' -
Swiss law generally allows assisted suicide if the person commits the lethal act themselves -- meaning doctors can not administer deadly injections, for example -- and the person consistently and independently articulates a wish to die.
Organisations that support assisted suicide also apply their own procedures, which are more robust than the legal requirements.
The authorities, aiming to take a position on the matter in the coming months, have asked the Swiss Centre of Expertise in Prison and Probation, a publicly funded foundation, to provide guidance following Vogt's request.
In October, the experts at the foundation advised that assisted suicide rights should apply to prisoners under certain conditions, noting that in cases of mental illness two independent specialists should be consulted.
Any detainee possessing discernment should, in principle, have assisted suicide rights if they have `` a physical or mental illness resulting in unbearable suffering, '' Barbara Rohner, lead author of the foundation's report, told AFP.
The foundation also recommended that authorities responsible for the prisoner's welfare must ensure the suicide request is not the result of a short-term emotional crisis.
Vogt insisted that he wanted to die because of the `` unbearable '' deterioration in his quality of life, along with the fact that he can no longer see his gravely ill mother, who lives in Austria.
He told the Blick newspaper that he wants to end his life on August 13, his 70th birthday.
- More requests coming? -
Rohner said that while Vogt's case may be exceptional, similar situations could increasingly arise.
`` There will be more and more elderly and sick prisoners in detention because of the ageing of the prison population, '' she said.
According to the Swiss National Science Foundation, a research institute, the number of prisoners over 50 years old doubled to 600 between 2005 and 2016.
Vogt told AFP that he knows of another inmate interested in assisted suicide, adding: `` Nobody should have to commit suicide in his cell alone. ''
Some have raised concern that assisted suicide requests could be used by convicts as a negotiating tactic to demand better conditions in prison.
For Christine Bussat, founder of the Swiss chapter of the Marche Blanche victims ' rights groups, decisions on a convict's right to die should rest with their victims.
That, she added, `` is unfortunately not possible '' under the current law.
But most legal and criminal justice experts in Switzerland believe that assisted suicide rights do extend to convicts.
Celine Ehrwein, an ethics professor at Heig-VD University, told public broadcaster RTS that depriving a suffering person of the right-to-die could be considered `` a form of torture ''.

58,"Maurice West talks 'Euforika, ' plans for 2020, and Skrillex ( Includes interview)","Hi, what are you looking for?
By
Published
On “ Euforika, ” he said, “ When I started releasing music on my own I needed a name for the platform or label that it was going to be shared through. At the time I had this word ‘ Euforika ” spinning around in my mind for a while. I didn’ t know what it was or how I came up with it, all I knew was that it sounded cool and could be part of something bigger. Then when my team and I agreed on using that term I decided to give it meaning: I live for making the most energetic, melodic, euphoric and emotional music I can and ‘ Euforika’ is the collective term for that style. ”
“ The people that listen to my music and come to my shows are also a big part of ‘ Euforika.’ They’ re the ones that make my songs come to life when I see that it puts a smile on their face when it makes them forget about any worries they might have or when they’ re just going absolutely crazy to it, ” West added.
On his music and songwriting, he said, “ There are a lot of different aspects of life that inspire me to make music. Of course, when I’ m on tour I get really inspired to make songs that will get a response out of the crowd. When I’ m in the studio I get inspired by music that I listen to ( which is mostly music that was made long before I was born). I can also get inspired by video or images, my brain has always made a very strong connection between sounds and shapes or colors. Lately, I’ ve started getting into songwriting more so I also really try to draw inspiration from stuff happening in my life. ”
Regarding his plans for 2020, he said, “ First and foremost, I want to release as much quality music as I can. I want to share this vision that I have with as many people as I can and let the whole world know what I’ m up to. I’ m really really passionate about the direction that I’ m headed in right now and just want to make as many people as possible happy with my songs. ”
On being an electronic artist in the digital age, he said, “ It’ s both really convenient and scary. I like how an independent artist is able to share his music to every corner of this planet just by hitting a few buttons on his computer. At the same time, everything on the Internet keeps moving faster and faster. People’ s attention spans get worse, but that also makes me want to create songs that are timeless. ”
Regarding his use of technology in his daily routine as a musician, he said, “ Of course I’ m listening to and creating music all day on my laptop. I hum melodies into my phone. I write down concepts and ideas for songs on my phone. I let my computer tell me which key the songs I want to play are in. Basically, without technology, I’ d be nowhere. Nevertheless, it’ s nice to step away from all your devices sometimes and just sit down behind a piano. The balance between real instrumentation and software has always been very important to me. ”
For young and aspiring DJs and producers, he said, “ The mistake I made at first was that I was so passionate and intrigued about the whole dance music scene that I just wanted to ‘ sound like’ all the big DJ’ s that I looked up to. If I could go back in time I would tell 16-year-old Maurice to let go of all the conventions and rules that he had learned from listening to dance music and just create whatever you feel like. Find your own sound and exploit it. Stand for what your creative mind came up with. ”
He listed Skrillex as his dream collaboration choice. “ Skrillex is on that list for sure. I actually got into dance music because of him. He has never failed to amaze me with anything that he put out. His way of producing is just out of this world. I’ d also love to see what artists like Stevie Wonder, Sister Sledge, Chic, Earth Wind & Fire, and George Benson would sound ( or would have sounded) like combined with dance music, ” he elaborated.
West defined the word success as follows: “ Success, to me, means reaching my goals, and there’ s some pretty crazy stuff on that list. My biggest goal is to let my music reach as many people as possible and bring joy to their lives. Success to me doesn’ t just mean that I get to have or feel something, I want all of my followers, friends, and family to be with me at that same spot. ”

On Nov. 30, 2020, S & P Global and IHS Markit announced they have entered into a definitive merger agreement to combine in an all-stock transaction which values IHS Markit at an enterprise value of $ 44 billion, including $ 4.8 billion of net debt.
In 2020, our people showed tremendous resilience, responsibility and resolve to support one another, our customers, our communities, our suppliers, and in doing so, have served our shareholders.
At S & P Global, we can’ t change the world overnight. But we can take action to affect change.
After a year that saw the dissemination of coronavirus vaccines, historic net-zero policy discussions, and the disruption of supply chains and energy markets, 2022 is likely to result in a recalibration of the global economy.
We enter 2022 with largely positive credit momentum, reflecting favorable financing conditions and a powerful economic recovery. This could be derailed if persistently high inflation pushes central banks to aggressively tighten monetary policy, triggering significant market volatility and repricing risks.
2021 brought hope for global economic growth following 2020’ s coronavirus-caused downturn, largely tied to the development and widespread deployment of COVID-19 vaccines and despite the rise of new variants.
In the next few decades, millions of lives and trillions of dollars will be at risk because of a single issue: climate change. Our research and analyses look at the related risks — and opportunities — that countries, companies, and investors face in addressing the changing climate.
While the extent and effectiveness of the global response to climate change remain uncertain, one thing is very clear: Companies and investors must prepare for a range of possible outcomes with diverging transition and physical risks. We look into these risks in our latest research, which debuted at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.
“ Our latest research shows that 60% of S & P500 companies, with a market capitalisation of $ 18 trillion, hold assets that are at high risk of at least one type of climate-related physical event. It’ s critical that companies fully understand their impact and dependency on ecosystems as well as the impact of a changing climate on their business operations. Trucost recently launched its Climate Change Physical Risk Analytics with the aim of helping companies and investors understand their exposure to a range of physical risks at the asset level including floods, droughts, wildfires, heatwaves and extreme weather events. ”
While the extent and effectiveness of the global response to climate change remain uncertain, one thing is very clear: Companies and investors must prepare for a range of possible outcomes with diverging transition and physical risks. This need for determined action to reduce emissions and limit the effects of climate change poses important transition risks for companies and investors through regulation, changing market dynamics, and technology, among other factors. As it stands, companies in the benchmark S & P 500 Index own physical assets across 68 countries globally—and 60% of these entities ( with a market capitalization of $ 18 trillion) hold assets that are at high risk of at least one type of climate-change physical risk. And while corporate-level resilience to both transition and physical risk varies greatly within and across sectors, S & P Global data show that heatwaves, wildfires, water stress, and hurricanes linked to increasing average global temperatures represent the biggest physical risks for companies in the S & P 500.
S & P Global Ratings ' look-back reviews published in 2017 and 2018 show that climate risk materially influenced less than 10% of our rating actions in recent years. Recent climate-related rating actions have typically stemmed from either physical risks, such as the 2018 wildfires in the case of Pacific Gas & Electric in the U.S. and Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria affecting reinsurers and local governments in 2017; or disruption to the operating environment in certain sectors. Current global warming trends suggest that the materiality of climate risk for ratings is only likely to increase in the future. The longer the delays in addressing current trends in climate change, the more likely we could see economic and social disruptions, due both to higher physical risks and the need to transition to a low-carbon economy at a faster pace.
What’ s the Deal with the 2-Degree Scenario? Under the 2015 Paris Agreement, nearly 200 countries agreed to limit global warming to no more than 2 degrees Celsius by 2100, and to aim for a no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius increase. The 2-degree scenario is widely seen as the global community’ s accepted limitation of temperature growth to avoid significant and potentially catastrophic changes to the planet.
Of the eight major economies that account for 67% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions, only Europe is gearing up to extend its Paris Agreement commitment after the European Parliament announced a climate emergency Thursday. Incoming European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen is set to call for EU member states to cut carbon emissions by at least 50% below 1990 levels by 2030, up from a current 40% reduction target. But ahead of the COP25 climate talks in Madrid, climate scientists say around 75% of current national plans are inadequate to put the globe on a path that meets the Paris Agreement's aim of limiting global warming to 1.5 to 2 degrees Celsius.
Policy changes introduced as economies adapt to climate change could wipe between $ 1.6 trillion to $ 2.3 trillion off the value of major global companies by 2025, and investors need to reflect that policy risk in their strategies, according to research conducted for the U.N.-backed group, Principles for Responsible Investment. According to an analysis by consultants Vivid Economics and Energy Transition Advisors, policy changes would reduce by 3.1% to 4.5% the value of companies on the benchmark global equity MSCI ACWI index, or the equivalent of the total value of the largest 12 to 33 companies on the London Stock Exchange's FTSE100.
The future financial and social consequences of climate change are becoming increasingly apparent to companies, investors and policy makers. Strong action to reduce emissions and limit climate change may avoid the worst physical impacts of climate change but presents significant market, technology and regulatory transition risks for market participants. Conversely, failure to adequately reduce greenhouse gas emissions may limit transition risks but will result in increasing climate change and associated physical risks.
Since S & P Global Ratings ' most recent review on the matter in December 2018, the need for climate change adaptation projects hasn't abated. Indeed, more people are noticing. We believe the recent surge in damage from extreme climate events has significantly increased the attention of public authorities on the need for investment in this area. According to the reinsurer Swiss Re, 2017-2018 insured losses from natural catastrophes, including climate related events, were $ 219 billion, the highest 24-month figure on record. In total, economic losses from natural catastrophes totaled $ 497 billion, with a further $ 40 billion during the first half of 2019. This implies uninsured losses from natural catastrophes of approximately $ 280 billion in 2017 and 2018 alone.
As more and more companies and investors conclude that sustainable practices make for sustainable returns, the assessment of corporations’ environmental, social, and governance ( ESG) footprints has moved from a simple measure of corporate responsibility to an investment proposition. While this general focus on ESG policies is undeniably beneficial, companies today are presented with the additional challenge of actively planning for climate risk. With a growing consensus around climate science, companies and investors must plan for a number of different scenarios, depending on the extent and impact of global climate change. However, an absence of shared terminology, benchmarks, and policies threaten to stymie investors and companies as they attempt to account for climate risk.
Global infrastructure spending has remained resilient in an environment of financial instability, underpinned mainly by interest from private sector investors. Private investors seeking long-term, stable returns are keen to fund infrastructure projects ranging from energy, to transport, to water infrastructure. These investors are providing support to governments facing a growing infrastructure funding gap. Yet, the sector is now awakening to the threats and opportunities that sustainability brings to realizing this long-term source of finance. Long-term climate risks are unlikely to leave any sector untouched as governments worldwide seek to maintain warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius under the 2015 Paris Agreement. This may force infrastructure projects to address energy use concerns, particularly as urban infrastructure consumes approximately two-thirds of global energy. Further, concerns over the recoupling of resource consumption and economic growth continue to grow. This adds pressure to address the resource-intensity of infrastructure often associated with the `` take, make, and dispose '' model under the linear economy.
Insurance coverage for some risks is becoming rarer and more costly as climate change alters the risk landscape, according to Zurich Insurance Group AG's chief risk officer. Speaking to S & P Global Market Intelligence following the release of the World Economic Forum's 2020 Global Risks Report, Peter Giger said certain perils are becoming increasingly expensive, and that while those price increases are justifiable, they are hitting communities affected by climate change.",business
82,New Label Insight CEO aims to transform grocery e-commerce,"After 17 years transforming the way brands, researchers and marketers understand shopper data, Todd Morris is ready to make similar changes to the information consumers get about products online.
Starting today, Morris, the former global president of shopper data and insights firm Catalina, is the new CEO of Label Insight. In this position, he told Food Dive he wants to fix the broken system consumers use to get information on grocery products.
Today's consumers who want information about food and beverage products often turn to the internet. Online grocery sales now account for 6.3% of grocery-related spending in the U.S., and have been used by 25% of households, according to an analysis last year from Brick Meets Click. Shoppers want to know which products meet their needs — such as if a particular item is gluten-free, high in protein, sustainably farmed or if a nearby retailer has organic vegetables.
But Morris said the way brands and retailers present information online makes this information much harder for consumers to find. Some of the problem is the antiquated way brands and retailers think about product information, he said.
`` Over 80% of all searches [ in ] online grocery are attribute based, not brand based. But there's no central place of truth of what attributes are accurate and standard and searchable, '' Morris said. `` And so I 'm really excited about bringing about an incredible new capability for consumers to find the products that meet their dietary and health and sustainability needs, but at the same time, helping... brands and retailers figure out how to win in a very different consumer-driven world. ''
During 17 years at Catalina, Morris changed the perception of shopper data from a transactional look focused on product quantities and dollars and cents to one that created a picture of who consumers are and their needs and desires.
Morris said understanding these consumer needs and desires is vital to improving the way product information is cataloged online. Today, he said, a consumer may do a search for `` peanut free '' and the first product that comes up is peanut butter. Or a consumer searches a retailer's site for gluten-free products and 16 items come up — but there are actually 260 gluten-free products in stock.
`` I 'm really excited about bringing about an incredible new capability for consumers to find the products that meet their dietary and health and sustainability needs, but at the same time, helping... brands and retailers figure out how to win in a very different consumer-driven world. ''
Todd Morris
CEO, Label Insight
`` An unanswered search for a consumer is like an empty shelf in a physical world, '' Morris said. `` Retailers are wired to never have an out-of-stock. And when there is one, they all jump on it and they fix it. We need to start treating a search the same way. ''
Label Insight has been working to solve this issue for years. It currently has a database containing hundreds of thousands of product attributes that can be used to describe items, ingredients and nutritional value.
Morris wants to use these attributes to both paint full pictures of products, but also to learn more about what consumers are looking for in terms of search and attributes. For example, he said almost half of consumers are following specific eating regimens. By paying attention to the keywords and searches shoppers use to arrive at the products they want, Label Insight can help retailers and brands find the items consumers would want in the future.
`` E-commerce is the easiest place to switch a retailer, '' he said. `` They [ consumers ] don't have to get in a car and drive to a new store. And so that ease of switching for the consumer will make the retailers who embrace this type of transparency and searchability or discovery real winners. ''

87,Nissan slams Ghosn's 'extremely regrettable ' escape,"Hi, what are you looking for?
By
Published
Japanese automaker Nissan on Tuesday slammed former chief Carlos Ghosn for jumping bail, calling his escape `` extremely regrettable '' and vowing continued legal action against him for `` various acts of misconduct ''.
Ghosn, who faced trial on financial misconduct charges that he denies, fled Japan on December 29 for Lebanon, in an elaborate and apparently carefully planned escape.
His bail-jumping has prompted outrage from Japanese officials, but he insists that he would have been unable to receive a fair trial in Japan.
In a statement, Nissan said Ghosn's escape `` in violation of his bail conditions is an act that defies Japan's judicial system. Nissan finds it extremely regrettable ''.
The firm said its `` robust, thorough internal investigation '' had `` incontrovertible evidence of various acts of misconduct by Ghosn ''.
`` The company will continue to take appropriate legal action to hold Ghosn accountable for the harm that his misconduct has caused to Nissan, '' it added.
Ghosn alleges the charges against him stem from a `` coup '' inside Nissan by disgruntled executives and local Japanese officials who feared his plans to more closely integrate the car giant with its alliance partner, French firm Renault.
Meanwhile, the Tokyo District Court confirmed on Tuesday it was keeping 1.5 billion yen ( $ 14 million) in bail owing to his escape.
Ghosn was released on bail in April under conditions that included a ban on overseas travel and limited contact with his wife.
The 65-year-old tycoon is due to give a news conference in Beirut on Wednesday, where he has said he will provide details about the alleged `` coup '' against him.
Details are gradually emerging about his audacious flight from Japan to Beirut via Istanbul -- a dramatic final twist in a story that has gripped the business world since his initial out-of-the-blue arrest in November 2018.
According to Japanese media, he slipped out of his house in Tokyo, boarded a bullet train to Osaka and then a private jet to Istanbul, concealed in a large box.
A transport ministry official has told AFP that security checks on luggage are not necessary for private jet operators and the box was apparently two big for the X-ray machines at the airport.
Justice Minister Masako Mori told reporters on Tuesday that this loophole had now been closed.
`` After Carlos Ghosn fled using illegal means, I have ordered controls to be reinforced. The transport minister has informed me that it is now compulsory to inspect significant luggage, including on corporate jets, '' added Mori.
This has been in place since Monday in Tokyo's main two airports Haneda and Narita, Kansai Airport ( from where Ghosn's jet left) and Nagoya, she said.

95,"Brooke Thackray's Top Picks: Jan. 7, 2020","The information you requested is not available at this time, please check back again soon.
Many investors believe that because the U.S. was one of the strongest markets in the world last year it will not repeat its feat for a second time in a row. This has not proven itself to be true, with emerging markets only outperforming the S & P four times in the last 10 years and the TSX only outperforming it twice.
To look for a turning point for U.S. markets, it is important to follow the performance of the U.S. dollar. If the U.S. dollar starts to falter, the probability that emerging markets and other stock markets around the world will outperform increases.
Brooke Thackray, research analyst at Horizons ETF Management Canada, discusses his top picks: The Horizons S & P/TSX Capped Energy Index ETF, the iShares Silver Trust Index ETF and TJX.
HORIZONS S & P/TSX CAPPED ENERGY INDEX ETF ( HXE: CT) HAC purchased on Dec. 23 at $ 16.14.
Energy was one of the worst-performing sectors last year. Over the last few months, it has been improving relative to the broad stock market. The seasonal period of strength for the sector is from Feb. 25 to May 9. Often, energy can bottom in January. Even aside from the geopolitical tensions, the energy sector is poised to move higher.
Silver has a seasonal period that lasts from Dec. 27 to Feb. 22. Recently, it’ s shown an improving relative performance to the broad market. Its recent rally has been mainly predicated on its precious metal qualities. Silver has benefitted from lower interest rates and increasing geopolitical tensions.
TJX has a similar seasonal period to the retail sector and tends to perform well from Jan. 23 to March 31. From 1990 to 2019, TJX has produced an average gain of 7 per cent yearly during this period, being positive 87 per cent of the time. TJX sells products at the lower end of the price range with its different brands. Some of its brands have benefitted from the online sales hurting the traditional bricks-and-mortar companies. With many of these companies have gone out of business, TJX has bought their product at dramatically reduced prices for their inventory.
Brooke Thackray, research analyst at Horizons ETF Management Canada, discusses his past picks: Horizons Gold ETF, SPDR Portfolio Small Cap ETF, the iShares Rusell 1000 Value ETF.
HORIZONS GOLD ETF ( HUG: CT) HAC purchased on Dec. 23 at $ 16.14.
Gold performed well in the summer months as a result of interest rates moving lower. In the second half of December and into January, gold has moved higher amid increased geopolitical tensions.
Small caps typically perform well at the beginning of the year, bouncing in January from tax-loss selling. So far, they have underperformed the S & P. The U.S. dollar being under pressure has not helped this performance. On a seasonal basis, the U.S. dollar can garner some strength in January and into February. If the greenback manages to do so, small caps could perform well over the next two to three months.
ISHARES RUSSELL 1000 VALUE ETF ( IWD: UN) HAC purchased Nov. 13 at $ 132.70.
Growth has strongly outperformed value since the start of the bull market in 2009, though value has occasionally taken its turn outperforming, mainly in its strong seasonal periods. The value sector has its next strong seasonal period from late February to mid-April. When the stock market moves into a corrective phase, value tends to outperform.
HORIZONS SEASONAL ROTATION ETF ( HAC: CT) Performance as of Dec. 31, 2019.
Annualized performance for periods of one year or greater. Fund’ s performance includes reinvested dividends and is net of fees.

NGI The Weekly Gas Market Report | LNG | LNG Insight | Markets | NGI All News Access
It took only hours after contracts were launched late last month on the New York Mercantile Exchange ( Nymex) for the first liquefied natural gas ( LNG) freight futures trades to be executed, a sign of the demand for more risk management in the gas export market.

Two London-based companies said they executed their first trades of the new contracts on Dec. 23 after they were launched by CME Group to cover three shipping routes.

Shipping services firm Clarksons said it helped complete the first trades between leading global commodity traders Trafigura Group Pte. Ltd. and Vitol. The trades covered 1Q2020 spreads between Australia’ s Gladstone LNG facility and Tokyo, as well as the Sabine Pass export terminal on the Gulf Coast and the UK. A contract covering Sabine Pass to Tokyo is also now listed on Nymex.

Shipbroker Affinity LLP also said it facilitated the first trades of the futures involving an affiliate of France’ s Total SA, a major global LNG portfolio player, and Trafigura. Affinity said the trades for clearing were submitted using CME’ s ClearPort system.

The contracts allow traders to hedge LNG freight costs, or the rates charged to carry the super-chilled fuel by ship. A spike in global supply from countries that include Australia, Russia and the United States, combined with revised rules for marine sector emissions and an ongoing trade war between the United States and China, have sowed uncertainty for the global shipping business.

While more tonnage, or available cargo-carrying capacity, is available in the LNG space amid the glut, demand has been robust and is expected to remain strong. The traditional point-to-point model that has served the LNG trade for decades under long-term contracts has evolved as a more diverse set of suppliers has entered the market and driven more spot cargos, creating a tighter shipping market and additional volatility.

“ We have seen an increase in demand from market participants wishing to manage freight exposure within LNG, ” said Clarksons’ Christian Greenop, a freight derivatives broker.

For example, some LNG ships traded in the single-voyage market early last year at a low of $ 10,000/day and broke the $ 170,000/day mark by October, Greenop said. “ So, a risk management tool is particularly useful given this level of volatility. ”

Traders that include Trafigura, which charter ships to move LNG, have reported sharp spikes in delivered volumes in recent years. Global seaborne trade last year was 356 million metric tons ( 47 Bcf/d), of which 30% was traded in the spot market. The seaborne trade is set to grow by 11% in 2020, according to Clarksons.

CME launched the LNG freight futures contracts as it works to bring more price transparency to the global market. The freight offering came after the exchange operator rolled out a U.S. LNG export futures contract last October. While that has been slow to take off, it was another effort to enhance short-term price discovery and risk management for the nascent Gulf Coast market.

Shipping costs factor heavily into the overall price for LNG depending on the destination. NGI’ s LNG Insight recently began publishing daily freight costs along a variety of trade routes, as well as spot vessel rates, or the costs to charter a ship.

128,"Koenigsegg, a supercar challenging Swedish stereotypes","Hi, what are you looking for?
By
Published
For a quarter century, Koenigsegg has been making supercars for a niche market typically reserved for Italian luxury brands, while challenging perceptions of Swedish modesty.
With brands like Volvo -- which introduced the three-point seat belt -- and Saab, Sweden distinguished itself in the 20th century as a maker of reasonable priced family-friendly cars that put safety first.
But in a workshop in the southern town of Angelholm, the term `` made in Sweden '' is given a new meaning, and horsepower and torque take centre stage.
`` When I started the company (...) I said to myself why would anyone buy one of my cars: it is an unknown brand, by an unknown person from a country not famous for sports cars, '' the company's founder Christian von Koenigsegg told AFP.
`` So I said to myself, they have to really stand out and be different and hopefully better in some ways than the competitors, '' he added.
The philosophy has been that if Bugatti and Pagani go fast, the Swedish car has to go faster and really push the limits, compensating for the lack of notoriety with performance.
In 2002, a mere eight years after the company was founded, the engine of the Koenigsegg CC8S was named the world's most powerful in a production car by Guinness World Records.
Two years later, the Koenigsegg CCR was named the World's most powerful serially produced car.
The Agera RS arrived in 2010 and in 2017 it set a speed record by reaching 447.19 kilometres per hour ( 277.87 miles per hour).
That record has since been broken by the Bugatti Chiron Super Sport 300+ with 490.48 kph ( 304.77 mph).
`` They did it on a closed track and we did it on a public road and we have not been dethroned as the fastest recorded speed on a public road by a production car (...) also, our record was with a production car while the Chiron was a pre series prototype, '' Christian von Koenigsegg argued.
`` But is was really impressive, '' he admitted.
- A rare sight -
While records and accolades are `` not so unimportant '' for von Koenigsegg, the most important thing is `` the overall performance of the car. ''
Hailing from a family with `` no real car interest, '' the tall Swede found his passion at an early age.
`` Since I was 6-7 years old, the only thing I read was car magazines or technical books about cars and things like that, '' he told AFP.
In 1994, he decided to pursue his dream of building `` the world's greatest super-sports car '' and started Koenigsegg.
Nearly a decade later, in March 2003, the first production car, the CC8S, was delivered at the Geneva Motor Show.
Sixteen other models have followed, but some models have been limited to as few as six units, and with a total of 250 cars in circulation a Koenigsegg remains a rare sight on the roads.
The brand also cultivates secrecy and won't confirm reports of high-profile buyers like footballer Zlatan Ibrahimovic or boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr.
The privilege of owning one of these supercars however comes at a price.
The latest model, the Jesko, will set you back about three million euros ( $ 3.3 million), but the 125 cars still sold out in two days.
It takes between seven and eight months to manually assemble the cars, and it requires a jeweller's precision.
`` It is a very different way of working than on a regular production, so of course it can be similar to jewelry, '' production manager Marian Gadau told AFP, adding that the manual assembly makes every car unique.
`` Even though all of them need to be at the same level... all of them are slightly different because it is the personal touch of working manually with every part. ''
In 2020, Koenigsegg plans to launch a new `` less expensive '' model -- at a more modest price of around one million euros -- but Christian von Koenigsegg stresses that it will still be hand made and `` in a niche where we don't see any cars today. ''

“ Since I was 6-7 years old, the only thing I read was car magazines or technical books about cars and things like that, ” he told AFP.
In 1994, he decided to pursue his dream of building “ the world’ s greatest super-sports car ” and started Koenigsegg.
Nearly a decade later, in March 2003, the first production car, the CC8S, was delivered at the Geneva Motor Show.
Sixteen other models have followed, but some models have been limited to as few as six units, and with a total of 250 cars in circulation a Koenigsegg remains a rare sight on the roads.
The brand also cultivates secrecy and won’ t confirm reports of high-profile buyers like footballer Zlatan Ibrahimovic or boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr.


The privilege of owning one of these supercars however comes at a price.
The latest model, the Jesko, will set you back about three million euros ( $ 3.3 million), but the 125 cars still sold out in two days.
It takes between seven and eight months to manually assemble the cars, and it requires a jeweller’ s precision.
“ It is a very different way of working than on a regular production, so of course it can be similar to jewelry, ” production manager Marian Gadau told AFP, adding that the manual assembly makes every car unique.
“ Even though all of them need to be at the same level… all of them are slightly different because it is the personal touch of working manually with every part. ”
In 2020, Koenigsegg plans to launch a new “ less expensive ” model — at a more modest price of around one million euros — but Christian von Koenigsegg stresses that it will still be hand made and “ in a niche where we don’ t see any cars today. ”

131,Tesla ( TSLA) Now Bigger Than Ford ( F) in Terms of Market Cap,"
Ford ( NYSE: F) is one of the biggest names in American automotive engineering and has been since there was an automobile industry in the United States, to begin with. Often required to share the stage with General Motors ( NYSE: GM) and what is now Fiat Chrysler ( NYSE: FCAU) as part of the “ Big Three ”, this iconic brand has been part of the American mystique for decades. Now, however, its status as part of the “ Big Three ” is somewhat in doubt with new reports that Tesla ( NASDAQ: TSLA) not only has a bigger market cap than Ford does right now, but a bigger market cap than Ford ever had, period.
Press F to Pay Respects
With the end of trading on Tuesday, Tesla saw shares jump 3.9%, hitting a then-record price of $ 469.06 per share. That's actually higher as of this writing, where shares reached $ 474.49 per share. Thanks to yesterday's closing price, that brings Tesla's market cap to just over $ 82 billion.
This sounds impressive on its own until you realize that Ford's maximum market cap—realized back during the massive economic boom that was 1999—has never been more than $ 80.8 billion. Those days are long past for Ford, however, whose market cap sits, at last report, at a little over $ 36 billion. By way of comparison, General Motors is up around $ 50 billion.
Tesla's Rocketsled Ride Upward
Tesla's market trajectory has been pretty well uphill for some time now. It's not only managed to beat short-sellers to the tune of $ 1.4 billion dollars in recent trading, it's also seen some bull cases that are downright staggering by just about any measure. It's actually about $ 25 off the recently-released Morgan Stanley bull case of $ 500 per share.
document.write ( ' < a style= '' text-decoration: none; font-weight: normal; color: # 696969; '' target= ''  blank '' rel= '' nofollow '' href= '' https: //www.ame ' + 'ricanconsumernews.net/scripts/click.aspx? NativeDisplayAdID=513 & ImpressionID=0 & UserID=0 & Placement=PlaceOnArticlePage '' > '); Trump's 5G plan is opening the flood gates to 3 million new jobs, $ 12.3 trillion in economic growth, and a brand new 5G device. One of the world's top angel investors – a tech genius named Jeff Brown believes the company behind this device is the Number One Tech Stock of 202, and it will go from $ 0 to nearly $ 100 billion in sales – this year.
Throw in the fact that its recent fourth-quarter deliveries were up—which suggests good things about its sales trajectory since it's probably not delivering vehicles that weren't sold to somebody at some point—and Tesla is starting to look less like a “ someday stock ” and more like a “ should have bought it three years ago stock ”.
Indeed, Tesla's forward path is also looking pretty bright, sufficiently so that CEO Elon Musk broke out in dance moves just recently, using Axwell Ingrosso's “ More Than You Know ” as the basis therein. Reports of expansion, of new factories going into play in China, and new product launches are giving Tesla's collective battery that much extra charge. Price target hikes at analysts like Wedbush certainly don't hurt matters.
Perhaps best of all was the word from Credit Suisse suggesting that cars may not be Tesla's only effective market path thanks to its extensive development of new battery technology, which has been in demand for years from homeowners looking to get the most out of home solar panel arrays.
Pumping the Brakes on the Supercharged Tesla Ride
However, there are some critical points to keep in mind here, for anyone considering mortgaging the house to buy Tesla stock. First, yes, it's absolutely true that Tesla's market cap right now is higher than Ford's ever was. No one can take that achievement away.
However, a look at DollarTimes.com—a calculator of the present value of money in the past—shows that the $ 80.8 billion that Ford was worth back in 1999 would be the equivalent of just over $ 123.8 billion today. Yes, Tesla's market cap is higher right now, but that's at least partially because the dollar today is worth quite a bit less than it was in 1999. Using the same value of a dollar, the $ 82 billion that Tesla is worth today is equivalent to just $ 53.49 billion back in 1999. It's also worth looking at the numbers of shares in play; Ford's current market cap is built around a share price that's been hovering in the $ 8- $ 10 range for the last year. Tesla's is built on the almost-freakish $ 469 price point.
Tesla's market cap is still a major achievement despite this—it's worth better than half of what Ford was in 1999 terms, and that's pretty good for a company whose product line has been in play only since 2008—yet there are further issues in play. There's the issue of the Cybertruck, whose launch was pretty roundly mocked, even if there were a surprising number of pre-orders involved. There's the issue of growing competition in the field, especially as Ford itself reported that pre-orders on the upcoming electric Mustang Mach E are full.
The news is good for Tesla right now, and it's clearly on a path toward holding that position. The odds of Tesla turning out like WeWork, for example, seem pretty low; Tesla quite clearly wants to be a going concern. Tesla certainly has a lot going for it right now, but the path to future growth—especially at the rates seen so far—looks somewhat dim thanks to the explosive growth of the last year or so and the increasing market forces arrayed against.
7 Gun Stocks to Buy During the Coronavirus Pandemic
Socially conscious investors may want to stop reading. But the fact is that gun stocks were some of the best-performing stocks at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. And they continue their positive momentum. Some of that may be historical. Firearms sales tend to increase during an election year. But of course, this has not started out as a normal election year. In March, the nation was gripped by pictures of long lines outside gun stores in several U.S. states. The website Ammo.com reported that bullet sales increased by 222% in the period from February 23 through March 15 as opposed to the first three weeks in February. And according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation’ s ( FBI) National Instant Criminal Background Check System ( NICS), there was a 73% year-over-year increase in background checks in February. “ The world has never seen anything like this and people want to make sure they're prepared for whatever lies ahead, whether that be food shortages, government shutdown, or worse, '' a spokesperson for Ammo.com said in an emailed statement. `` When everything around you is uncertain, having a supply of ammunition can make our customers feel safer. '' Given the likelihood of increased firearms sales, we’ ve created this presentation that highlights seven gun stocks that you should consider for your portfolio.

139,Magnum thinks pink with ruby chocolate ice cream bar launch,"U.S. chocolate lovers, it is time: Ruby chocolate is finally coming to the masses through a CPG launch.
Ruby, which is described as the fourth type of chocolate, comes from a distinct cacao bean discovered by scientists working at global chocolatier Barry Callebaut more than a generation ago. In recent years, the company discovered how to process these beans and produce dark-pink-hued ruby chocolate, which has a distinct tart taste reminiscent of berries.
The chocolate was officially unveiled in Asia in 2017, and Japanese consumers have been able to buy it for more than two years. Soon after, it also rolled out across Europe, Australia, Africa and South America, but hit a labeling stumbling block in the U.S. The FDA would not permit the confection to be labeled as `` chocolate, '' which has a strict definition in federal regulations.
About a year ago, Barry Callebaut partnered with a few high-end chocolate makers in the U.S. to produce a limited stock of the pink chocolate for the country. It was labeled `` ruby cacao '' or `` ruby couverture '' so it didn't violate regulations.
In May, the chocolate supplier announced it would make ruby widely available in the U.S. and Canada, despite not yet getting the labeling clearance it was seeking. The new Magnum bars seem to be the first big U.S. CPG product launch with ruby. And despite the FDA last month granting Barry Callebaut a temporary marketing permit allowing it to label up to 60 million pounds of the confection `` ruby chocolate, '' the press release and packaging of the Magnum product label it `` ruby cacao. ''
While Barry Callebaut is providing ruby chocolate to any confectioner that wants it, Laura Bergan, the company's director of innovation for specialties marketing, told Food Dive last year that ruby is expected to stay in the premium market. This makes Magnum a fit to take it on first. The brand defines itself as luxurious, decadent and premium, using Belgian chocolate and top-of-the-line ingredients for its ice cream.
Even though the new ruby bars are using the exclusive chocolate, their price will be in line with the company's other offerings. For a package of six Magnum Ruby Minis, the company lists a suggested retail price of $ 4.99.
While this is the first big offering of the pink confection, it is not likely to be the last. As grocery store shelves crowded with heart-shaped boxes clearly show, Valentine's Day is about a month away. And according to data from the National Retail Federation, 52% of people who celebrated the holiday last year planned to spend about $ 1.8 billion on candy. NRF stats show fewer people chose to celebrate Valentine's Day last year — yet more total money was spent — so premium pink chocolates could be a way to send hearts and wallets aflutter.
Even outside of holidays celebrated with pink hearts and chocolate, ruby is bound to be popular. Nestlé was among the first CPG manufacturers to use ruby outside of the U.S., and it's been adding it to its products in response to brisk demand. Barry Callebaut keeps a collection of pictures of uses for the chocolate around the world on its website, and as more U.S. confectioners experiment with it, more creative ideas are guaranteed to fill this page.

147,WHO Says Mysterious Illness in China Likely Being Caused by New Virus,"The World Health Organization confirmed on Wednesday that Chinese authorities believe a new coronavirus—from the family that produced SARS and MERS—may be the cause of mysterious pneumonia cases in the city of Wuhan.
The Chinese government has not yet publicly stated that a coronavirus is the cause of the illness, which has infected at least 59 people. But the Wall Street Journal reported that was the case earlier Wednesday, citing unnamed sources.
“ Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that range from the common cold to SARS. Some cause less-severe disease, some more severe. Some transmit easily from person to person, while others don’ t, ” the WHO statement said.
The virus can cause severe illness in some patients, the agency said, adding that it does not “ transmit readily ” between people. Earlier statements from the Wuhan Municipal Health Authority said there has been no person-to-person spread—a claim disease experts say is impossible to make at this stage in the exploration of a new disease.
“ I don’ t know how you know that at all, ” said Matthew Frieman, a coronavirus expert at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. He noted the number of cases reported makes it seem unlikely that animal-to-human transmission is the only way this virus spread.
The WHO said that as authorities home in on the cause—and develop better detection tools — the number of cases associated with this outbreak may rise.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention sent out an alert to health care providers — a Health Alert Network or HAN — notifying them of the outbreak and urging them to ask patients with severe respiratory infections if they had traveled recently to Wuhan, which is 700 miles south of Beijing.
The fact that a coronavirus may be responsible will come as no surprise to the infectious diseases experts who have been watching the situation unfold. The type of illness and the fact that it is emerging in China — where a number of SARS-like and other coronaviruses have been isolated from bats—has pointed in that direction.
Experts said it will now be important for China to share more information, including enough of a genetic sequence so that health facilities outside of China know what to look for when faced with a pneumonia case with a recent travel history to Wuhan.
As it currently stands, Hong Kong is isolating any such cases until they can be tested for influenza, rhinoviruses, and other viruses that cause colds and flu. Given it is flu season in the Northern Hemisphere, telling countries to be on the look out for travelers with fevers and cold-like symptoms casts a very broad net.
“ It really behooves them to at least provide enough information to allow the global community to be ready to do testing, ” said Ralph Baric, a coronavirus expert at the University of North Carolina. “ Otherwise you’ re just doing screening for fever — in the middle of respiratory disease season? Financial nightmare. ”
It will also be critical to figure out how the virus transmitted to people. The outbreak has been linked to a large seafood market that also sells live exotic animals for consumption. The market was closed and decontaminated on Jan. 1.
Baric said investigations will be underway to identify which species—singular or plural—was infected in the market.
“ Understanding the reservoir is critical for eliminating that whole aspect of animal-to-human jump, ” Frieman said.
Identifying the reservoir of the virus will also require tracing the animals suspected of being infected back to their suppliers so that it can be determined whether other markets might also have received infected animals.
During the 2003 SARS outbreak—in which more than 8,000 people were infected and nearly 800 died—the source of the virus was traced to palm civets that are eaten as a delicacy in parts of China. The Chinese government ordered a mass culling of the animals as part of its effort to stop the outbreak.
News of the pneumonia cases first emerged on Dec. 30, when the local health authority told hospitals to be on the lookout for cases. The next day Chinese authorities informed the WHO that they were dealing with what looked like an outbreak caused by an unknown virus.
In its most recent update, the Wuhan Municipal Health Authority said there had been 59 cases, seven of which were in critical condition. The statement said the first known case began showing signs of illness on Dec. 12 and the last case of illness onset was Dec. 29.

148,"Mars collaborates to boost cacao yields, quality and disease resistance","Mars, Inc., is committing to a 100% sustainable supply chain to meet its future cacao needs. The family-owned company has joined with agricultural analytics company Nature Source Improved Plants to more quickly develop new cacao varieties with greater yields, better disease resistance and higher quality, according to a NSIP release.
Mars ' `` Cocoa for Generations '' strategy will help the CPG company show leadership in this effort. It also may inspire other partners to work on boosting farmer income, protecting children from hazardous labor conditions and preserving forests, the release said. This won't be easy since cacao is often competing for land with palm oil and rubber production, and better agricultural practices can't solve all of the problems, it added.
Worldwide cacao demand is projected to increase about 5% per year for the foreseeable future, NSIP said. Greater demand usually results in more acres being planted, but adding more cacao trees has also caused deforestation and environmental destruction, the company added.
Because of its well-known candy brands — including M & Ms, Snickers, Twix, Milky Way and Dove — Mars has an avid interest in maintaining a sustainable cacao supply. However, improving quality and yield through breeding takes many years and a lot of money before the investment will bear fruit, David Mackill, the company's director of genetics and breeding, noted in the release.
This is where NSIP comes in. The plant analytics firm uses new breeding technologies based on advanced genomics, which have enhanced productivity and quality in field, vegetable, perennial and orphan crops. At the same time, the company said this method limits research and development expenses. NSIP also said it develops in vitro propagation techniques to help growers producing perennial plantation crops such as cacao.
According to the European Commission, about 4 million tons of cocoa beans are needed annually to keep up with demand, which requires 500 million new plants each year. Given the rising market demand for cocoa and the production challenges — climate change, declining yields, aging farmers, volatile prices and crop diseases — better ways to produce plants are required. Consequently, micropropagation has become important to more quickly produce higher-quality plants with greater disease resistance.
This isn't Mars ' first effort to enhance its cocoa supply. The company announced in September 2018 it would spend $ 1 billion over a decade to improve sustainability of the supply chain. At the time, John Ament, the company's global vice-president of cocoa, told Reuters the traditional cocoa supply chain is `` broken '' because it often does little to help local workers and prevent environmental degradation. The company pledged to responsibly source all of its cocoa by 2025.
Such promises from Big Food are common, but the success rate is not high. According to a Greenpeace report released last year, none of more than 50 CPG firms, retailers and producers had shown meaningful efforts to rid deforestation from their supply chains.
Still, the report recognized some chocolate makers — Nestlé, Lindt, Mars, Mondelez, Cargill and Barry Callebaut — had made progress. Cargill promoted good farming practices with its Cargill Cocoa Promise, Barry Callebaut achieved 44% sustainably sourced cocoa in 2018, and Hershey pledged a $ 500 million investment in West African cocoa sustainability, Greenpeace said.
Beyond the pledges and investments, some manufacturers using chocolate as an ingredient are upcycling parts of the cacao fruit to limit waste and boost revenue. Nestle announced last summer it had developed a new chocolate-making technique using only cacao fruit pulp and no added refined sugar for sweetening. And Barry Callebaut debuted snack products in September 2019 using cacao fruit parts usually thrown out.
Tangible results of more sustainable practices could attract the increasing numbers of consumers on the lookout for these qualities, and innovative chocolate makers are liable to reap the rewards when they do.

151,Could collagen dominate food and beverage in 2020?,"From popcorn and drinks to bars and snacks, this ingredient is popping up in more products as consumers increasingly reach for functional foods.
Jen Berliner remembers noticing consumers tagging her organic beverage company Medlie in Instagram posts. The images and videos showed people pouring packets of collagen into their blended vegetable drinks, mashes and shots — so she decided to make it easier for them.
In what Berliner calls a `` consumer-led decision, '' the company partnered with Whole30 to launch its Kale Avocado Protein Drink with Collagen in the summer of 2018 and on the first day it debuted, it was already a hit.
`` We, candidly, didn't know how it was going to do and that day remains one of our single biggest sales days ever, it has basically stayed as our No. 1 SKU ever since then, and we 've introduced a number of other collagen SKUs and products, '' the CEO told Food Dive. `` It's something that we really continue to lean into and respond to the consumer demand. ''
But it is not just Medlie getting in on the collagen trend. The ingredient — one of the most abundant proteins in the body — is poised for growth in 2020 as more people look for greater functional health benefits in what they consume. The global collagen market is projected to reach $ 6.6 billion by 2025 with an annual growth rate of 6.5%, according to a new report by Grand View Research.
`` Everything that we're seeing on our side is certainly no signs of slow down here. We're only seeing more and more demand for collagen products. ''
Jen Berliner
Medlie, CEO
Made popular in the U.S. in the 1980s as a pricey injectable filler to plump lips and soften lines, collagen has been finding its way into a variety of foods and beverages, from bars to salty snacks.
In more recent years, studies have shown that ingesting collagen for several months can improve skin elasticity and signs of aging as well as joint, back and knee pain. Other research, however, has said those health claims are exaggerated. So despite the increasing popularity and its reputation for health benefits, there are still many questions about its impact.
`` It’ s definitely among the top three products people ask me about, and I believe it does hold promise in some diverse areas of medicine, '' Mark Moyad, director of the complementary and alternative medicine program at the University of Michigan Medical Center told WebMD. `` It’ s also one of the most wacky and controversial. ''
But those questions haven't stopped collagen manufacturers from developing ingredients and integrating the product into more food and beverage as demand increases.
Last year, InterGanics launched a new high-purity product, called PeptPure Collagen Peptides, and a re-engineered process that they say delivers higher levels of purity, traceability, sustainability and transparency.
Felipe Chaluppe, president and CEO of InterGanics, told Food Dive collagen is still in an early stage of its lifecycle, but with more CPG companies getting into the space in the last five years, it has `` exploded. ''
“ It became very popular and... everybody understands the benefits of collagen and what it does, and I think it is just going to continue to grow because more applications are coming up, more delivery systems are being developed, ” he said.
SkinnyPop, which Hershey acquired in 2017, released a collagen popcorn last year. Chaluppe said that product caught his attention because the word collagen was so large on the package.
`` You couldn't really tell if they were selling popcorn with collagen or collagen with popcorn because of the packaging, '' he said. `` It was eye-catching. ''
He said that product is an example of the evolution of consumer awareness, as well as increased availability and more delivery technologies for collagen, which signals that this ingredient will be a big part of the industry `` for many, many years. ''
Kamal Elamri, co-founder of Zeebar, told Food Dive that his company’ s protein bars contain the highest amount of collagen per bar in the market at 14 grams each.
Elamri, who is originally from Morocco, said he noticed that bars in the U.S. had many additional and artificial ingredients so he sought to develop a bar with `` a pure list of ingredients. '' He wanted to combine argon oil, a popular ingredient in Morocco, with a protein to make his company's products.
While researching non-dairy proteins that were good for digestion, Elamri said they came across collagen and decided to use it because of its reported positive effects on skin, joints and fighting inflammation.
`` We like collagen because it is a really good way to get your protein intake and to also get health benefits from it, '' Elamri said. `` All those other protein supplements, like whey, they just have protein in it and nothing else really. ''
He said more consumers are looking to have added benefits from their food, which is a current trend across the industry. A white paper from ingredients company Kerry found that 65% of consumers seek functional benefits from their food and drink.
Medlie's Berliner said 2020 could bring more products that combine that functionality with convenience by offering more foods and drinks with collagen already infused. The ease of ready-to-drink appeals to consumers, she said, because of the convenience of not having to scoop, mix and shake collagen into products.
`` Something that people really love about our products is that we're delivering... all the protein and benefits of collagen in a bottle that they can grab from the fridge and walk out the door, '' she said. `` Everything that we're seeing on our side is certainly showing no signs of slow down here. We're only seeing more and more demand for collagen products. ''

169,Portugal investigating billionaire daughter of Angola ex-president,"Hi, what are you looking for?
By
Published
Portuguese is investigating embezzlement claims against Isabel dos Santos, the billionaire daughter Angola's former president, the prosecutor general's office told AFP Friday.
The investigation comes after judicial authorities confirmed receipt of a complaint from Ana Gomes, a former Socialist lawmaker in the European parliament against Dos Santos.
Financial daily Jornal Economico reported last Friday that Gomes had passed to the Portuguese authorities `` elements '' she says cast doubt on the nature of funds which Dos Santos, nicknamed Africa's wealthiest woman, invested in former colonial power Portugal.
Last month, an Angolan court said it was freezing the assets of Dos Santos as part of an anti-graft campaign amid allegations of nepotism under the 38-year rule of rule of her father Jose Eduardo dos Santos, who left office in 2017.
According to the Angolan prosecutor general, Isabel dos Santos and her Congolese husband Sindika Dokolo are suspected of laundering a billion dollars worth of foreign currency during Dos Santos senior's 38-year rule, which ended in 2017.
Isabel dos Santos was appointed head of Angola's national oil company Sonangol in 2016, but was forced out by her father's successor President Joao Lourenco shortly after he came to power.
The corruption probe -- targeting several members of the former ruling family -- is looking at alleged irregularities involving Sonangol and also Sodiam, a national diamond-marketing firm.
Dos Santos, whom Forbes magazine named Africa's first woman billionaire in 2013, holds multimillion investments in Portugal's telecoms and financial sectors.
Last year, the Bank of Portugal revealed it would seek to follow up and `` new facts '' brought to light by the Angolan judicial authorities which could bring into question her eligibility to remain as a shareholder with Portuguese bank EuroBic.

174,New-found cannabis compound 30 times more potent than THC,"Hi, what are you looking for?
By
Published
While Cannabis sativa has over 400 known compounds, only one, tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC is known to produce a high in humans. At least that has been the case – until recently when a group of Italian researchers announced on December 30th the discovery of two new cannabinoids found in C. sativa.
One of the compounds is a THC-lookalike, so much so that they named it tetrahydrocannabiphorol ( THCP). It appears to interact with the same receptor as THC, the receptor known as CB1, according to the new study published on December 30, 2019, in the journal Scientific Reports.
The CB1 receptors Interestingly, the key differences between THC and the new-found chemical THCP lie in the chain of atoms jutting off the new compound. Research done in 2016 suggests that this side-chain of atoms, called an alkyl side chain, is what allows THC to “ plug-in ” to its preferred receptor in the body.
A cannabinoid must have at least three carbon rings in its side-chain in order to hook up to the CB1 receptor. THC compounds contain five carbon rings. Calculations on paper suggested that a compound with more than five carbon rings would fit even more tightly to the CB1 receptor.
Further calculations determined that if the compound had eight carbon rings, it would fit perfectly into the CB1 receptor, thereby eliciting the strongest biological response. However, the authors say there is no known compound with those perfect attributes in nature.
Along comes THCP The researchers found that THCP has not five – but seven carbon rings in its alkyl side chain. Tested in a Petri dish using a concocted receptor, the THCP compound tended to bind the substance 30 times more reliably than THC did.
The THCP compound was then tested on lab mice, although in relatively low doses. The mice behaved as though they were on THC, with slower movement, lower body temperatures and reaction times slowed. The study said it would have taken twice the dose of THC to induce the same effects.
Whether or not the new compound would have the same effects in humans as it did in the lab mice is unknown. But as Vice.com suggests, this could explain why smoking different marijuana blends can give notably different effects. And while THC offers some medicinal effects, including pain and nausea relief, no one knows if THCP has these qualities
CBD lookalike also found The research team also found a CBD lookalike with seven carbon rings, calling it cannabidiphorol ( CBDP). This compound doesn’ t bind strongly with the CB1 or its related receptor, CB2. While CBD has been tied to anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and anti-seizure effects, investigating these effects in CBDP “ does not appear to be a high priority, ” the authors wrote.

180,Op-Ed: Trump has given Americans a crash-course on propaganda,"Hi, what are you looking for?
By
Published
For the past six days, Twitter has been in a frenzy, with talk of World War 111, accusations of elaborate foreign psychological warfare, coordinated disinformation campaigns, and manipulation from unknown sites, presumable bots, according to Buzzfeed News.
“ Be aware that we are experiencing a stunning volume of troll & disinformation activity on Twitter, ” Florida Republican Senator Marco Rubio tweeted Tuesday night as Iran fired a dozen ballistic missiles at two military bases in Iraq that house US troops. “ We are witnessing coordinated informational warfare regarding # IranAttack spreading false information designed to create confusion and division. ”
And during those same six days, the public heard, via Twitter, numerous accounts of what was supposed to be the truth – from President Donald J. Trump himself. However, I don’ t think Senator Rubio was referring to Trump’ s tweets in his warning.
And all this is true, being some of the same tactics used by Russia in recent years to increase polarization in the country, destabilize society, and undermine faith in democratic institutions. But sadly, with the continuing rise of social media, there is no end in sight to the volume of misinformation or propaganda that will be dumped on the public.
And Trump and his campaign officials have become very adept at using social media. Platforms like Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, and Twitter are the most direct way to target and reach any voter, thereby creating a new form of “ smart ” politics. And for the millions of faithful Trump followers, it is a way to keep the faith.
The Twitter-based presidency Trump has carefully developed a novel political relationship with his followers. Social media has made possible a unique interaction between a political figure and his base that is the beginning of a new, arguably more “ democratic ” model of political dissemination, according to Diggit Magazine.
January 9, 2020
While Diggit Magazine says this new model of political discourse is “ Democratic ” because it is largely made up by the citizens themselves who determine what political figures and ideologies are deemed worthy of popularity based on likes or dislikes, it bothers me that while this may be a fair way to judge an issue or political figure, it does not address the truthfulness of what is being posted.
And this is where Trump’ s go-fers and followers have succeeded in creating a strong, online influence. Not only do they post piles of content praising Trump for whatever he says he has done on his latest tweet, regardless of it being a lie, but they have select groups of political operatives using social media to create ugly content that plays to partisan bias and goes viral online.
Trump’ s campaign has used online advertising data and tools to find traumatized people and target them with intentionally provocative fear-based messages and ads on Facebook. As of this week, the Trump campaign has spent $ 2.3 million on more than 33,000 ads over the past 30 days, according to the Facebook ad library report.

A new era of dirty politics and disinformation I don’ t claim to be the brightest bulb in the box, but I certainly am smart enough to think outside that box – and after mulling over Trump’ s strong hold over his supporters, I have come to the conclusion that it is a well-orchestrated campaign.
With his overly-large ego, Trump has highlighted his importance and that of his message by constantly remaining online. “ By posting multiple times daily, Trump and his opinions are constantly ‘ trending,’ continuously reinforcing his strong online influence., ” writes Diggit Magazine.
Trump’ s followers read and retweet everything he puts on social media. I read recently that when a person is this taken in by a candidate – they refuse to look objectively at any issue and dismiss misinformation put out by that candidate. It’ s like they close their mind to actual facts. I can see where this is possible after perusing Trump’ s tweets.

182,Curtain falls on Chinese film festival as censorship intensifies,"Hi, what are you looking for?
By
Published
One of China's longest-running independent film festivals has decided to shut down against the backdrop of mounting government censorship, saying it was no longer possible to run a `` purely independent '' festival in the country.
The China International Film Festival ( CIFF) made the announcement in a post Thursday on its official WeChat social media account.
`` We believe that under current local organisational conditions it is impossible to organise an effective film festival that has a pure, independent spirit, '' it said.
The statement gave no other details on the reasons, but the shutdown comes amid a dramatic tightening of censorship on Chinese media and entertainment under the government of President Xi Jinping.
The CIFF was founded in the eastern city of Nanjing in 2003 and was staged 14 times, its announcement said.
The festival was known to have screened films on sensitive subjects such as homosexuality and controversies surrounding the massive Three Gorges Dam project in central China.
China has long operated what is widely considered the most sophisticated online censorship apparatus, which blocks Chinese internet users from accessing a wide range of content that the government considers politically objectionable.
But under Xi -- the most powerful Chinese leader in decades -- Beijing has ramped up censorship while pushing a nationwide drive for more media that glorifies the ruling Communist Party.
Hong Kong's South China Morning Post quoted Zhang Xianmin, a Beijing Film Academy professor and the festival's key organiser, as saying the shutdown takes China back to a more restricted era for film.
`` We just went back to 20 years ago, when there was no room and opportunity for independent films, '' Zhang was quoted as saying.
A range of other annual film festivals continue to operate in China.

201,IBM at CES: Quantum breakthrough news,"Hi, what are you looking for?
By
Published
According to IBM, the 2020s are set to become the decade of commercial quantum computing. The global computing and research firm has announced three pioneering quantum research breakthrough.s.
IBM Q Network expands
The first key announcement from IBM concerns the expansion of the IBM Q Network, which has reached a milestone of nearly 100 organizations working with IBM. Various companies are helping to advance the technology and explore practical applications. The companies involved include Delta Airlines, Anthem, and the Los Alamos National Lab. The grouping forms part of the largest commercial quantum computing program available, comprised of Fortune 500 companies, startups, academic institutions and research labs with access to the world’ s largest fleet of quantum computing systems.
In joining the network, Delta becomes the first airline to explore the potential capabilities of quantum computing. The airline is examining how the technology can be used to transform experiences for customers and employees and address challenges across the day of travel. The project will involve accessing technology via the IBM Q Hub, which is located at NC State University.
Developing automotive batteries
With the second piece of news, IBM and Daimler have unveiled initial research into next-generation automotive batteries. This is in recognition that electric vehicles have an Achilles Heel: the capacity and speed-of-charging of their batteries.
Together, the two companies are using a quantum computer to simulate the chemical make-up of lithium-sulfur batteries, which is believed to offer higher energy densities than its predecessor, lithium-ion. The goal is to use a quantum computer to one day help design an entirely new, more powerful and rechargeable battery.
Doubling quantum power
With the third development, IBM has unveiled news that the company has reached a new scientific milestone, announcing its highest quantum volume to date, doubling the performance metric from 16 to 32. Quantum Volume is a measurement that determines how powerful a quantum computer is and will be key to achieving “ Quantum Advantage, ” — a point when quantum applications deliver a significant, practical benefit beyond what classical computers alone are capable.
The news items were announced by Dario Gil, Director of IBM Research, who hosted a session at CES 2020, joined by leaders from Daimler AG and ExxonMobil. This fed into a discussion about how quantum computing is set to radically change computing and the world as we know it and why many believe quantum is the next big thing in technology.
Areas where quantum computing is set to drive industry forwards includes the development of new drugs and materials, batteries that are 1000x better, efficient supply chains and new transportation systems, to name a few.

203,Oscar nominees emerge as awards row rages over female snubs,"Hi, what are you looking for?
By
Published
The Oscar nominations will Monday reveal which stars and movies have a shot at Hollywood's ultimate prize, as the industry nervously awaits the number of women and minorities selected.
The pre-dawn Academy Award announcement caps months of ceaseless campaigning by A-listers and studios, with only the chosen few progressing to next month's show-stopper.
Favorites for best picture include Quentin Tarantino's 1960s Tinseltown homage `` Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood, '' and Sam Mendes's World War I odyssey `` 1917. '' Both won major honors at the recent Golden Globes.
Martin Scorsese's crime epic `` The Irishman '' and South Korean class satire `` Parasite '' are also expected to feature. Up to 10 films can be nominated for the top prize.
Much of the focus so far this award season has been on the lack of women and ethnic minority filmmakers honored.
Neither the Globes nor the influential Directors Guild Awards included any female-helmed films in their top categories, with Greta Gerwig's acclaimed `` Little Women '' adaptation notably absent.
Controversy over those omissions, in an industry criticized for its lack of diversity, was fueled at last week's Bafta nominations, which were also condemned for overlooking ethnic minorities.
One Academy voter who asked not to be named said he was `` anticipating that it's likely going to be very controversial '' again Monday because `` a lot of male directors '' will be nominated.
`` Unfortunately there are just five nominees '' for best director in an `` incredibly strong year, '' he told AFP, pointing to the revered track records of Scorsese, Tarantino and Mendes.
The Academy `` want to choose the best but they also want to be sensitive to women and minorities, '' said Chris Beachum, of award tracking website Gold Derby.
Non-white stars such as Lupita Nyong ' o, Cynthia Erivo and Awkwafina could feature alongside best actress frontrunners Renee Zellweger and Charlize Theron, he predicted, while Eddie Murphy is in the running for best actor.
`` Greta ( Gerwig) certainly has a shot at becoming the first woman to get in for ( best) director twice, '' Beachum added, referring to her nomination for 2017's `` Lady Bird. ''
- Competitive best actor field-
Voting for Oscar nominees ended last Tuesday, two days after the Golden Globes, meaning success there could have provided a late bump for borderline candidates.
Taron Egerton, who plays Elton John in `` Rocketman, '' faces a tough challenge to crack into a competitive best actor field expected to feature the likes of Joaquin Phoenix ( `` Joker. '')
But he may be aided by his Globes success, Beachum said.
Renee Zellweger, who won best actress at the Globe, is widely seen as a shoo-in for the Oscars shortlist, thanks to her acclaimed turn as showbiz legend Judy Garland in `` Judy. ''
Awards pundits will also be checking to see how the best picture frontrunners fare in other Oscars nominations categories.
`` 1917 '' has relative unknowns in its main roles, meaning acting nods would be a strong indicator of overall success, said Beachum.
An editing nomination for the film, shot to appear as it were almost one continuous shot, would also speak volumes, he added.
- 'Theatrical experience ' -
Despite its disappointment at the Globes, where it won just one movie award, Netflix still has more contenders than any other studio -- and is likely to bag plenty of nominations.
`` They 'll win some Oscars, '' said Beachum. `` Every year that they 've been in the Oscar race they 've improved on nominations and wins. ''
As well as `` Irishman, '' the small-screen streaming giant should grab nods for divorce drama `` Marriage Story, '' Vatican-set `` The Two Popes '' and Murphy's blaxploitation biopic `` Dolemite Is My Name. ''
But one Academy voter warned that `` some members will, as filmmakers, want to preserve the theatrical experience '' by choosing films from traditional studios which have long, exclusive runs in movie theaters.
Some 9,000 Academy members vote for the Oscars.
In the round of voting just closed, members were asked to rank their top choices only for best picture, and for the specific Academy branch to which they belong.
Voting for winners -- in which members can vote in every category -- begins January 30, closing five days later.
The Oscars will be handed out in Hollywood on February 9.

209,Healing powers of Manuka honey explored in new study,"Hi, what are you looking for?
By
Published
The antimicrobial properties in the honey appear to be due to a compound found within the honey called methylglyoxal, according to an investigation conducted at Newcastle University in the U.K.. Having identified the specific compound, this could enable researchers to use the compound in medical devices in order to promote wound healing.
An example of such a device is a surgical mesh. The reason for focusing on devices like a mesh is while a mesh is needed to provide support for tissue regeneration, the design of the mesh also provides opportunity for bacterial biofilms to develop, which increases the chances of a patient becoming infected.
Mānuka honey is a monofloral honey produced from the nectar of the mānuka tree, Leptospermum scoparium.
To assess the compound, a study was set up whereby nanolayers of Manuka honey were carefully inserted between layers of a polymer. Following this, an electrostatic nanocoating was produced ( with the field created between the honey, which has a negative charge, and the polymer, which carries a positive charge). A simulation of wound healing was conducted, whereby the honey was allowed to be slowly released over a three week period. This was demonstrated to inhibit bacterial growth over the study period.
Further work trying different layers of the honey were attempted, with the most effective quantity found to be what the researchers are calling a 16-layered ‘ charged sandwich’.
Commenting on the study, lead researcher Dr. Piergiorgio Gentile states: “ These results are really very exciting. Honey has been used to treat infected wounds for thousands of years but this is the first time it has been shown to be effective at fighting infection in cells from inside the body. ”
The researcher also states that the use of the honey in this way represents one of the most effective antimicrobial materials that have been tried to date. While effective, the properties have, so far, only been tested out in culture against the bacteria Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. Further work will need to conducted against an animal model.
The research, outing the success of combining a naturally occurring antimicrobial material with nanotechnology, has been reported to the journal Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology. The research paper is titled “ Potential of Manuka Honey as a Natural Polyelectrolyte to Develop Biomimetic Nanostructured Meshes With Antimicrobial Properties. ”

Daily GPI
NGI The Weekly Gas Market Report | E & P | NGI All News Access
BlackRock Inc., the world’ s No. 1 asset manager with nearly $ 7 trillion in investments, plans to shift how funds are allocated, which could include exiting stocks that “ present a high sustainability-related risk, ” including for some fossil fuels projects.

In his annual letter marking what could be a watershed moment for the investment community, BlackRock founder and CEO Larry Fink pledged the firm would vote against management teams that are not making progress on sustainability.

Nearly five years ago, Blackrock had noted how the rising impact of climate change was impacting investments. However, the firm’ s estimable sponsorship of global oil and natural gas projects is not ending in the near term, and it will in fact remain one of the top investors in energy projects.

“ Under any scenario, the energy transition will still take decades, ” Fink wrote. “ Despite recent rapid advances, the technology does not yet exist to cost-effectively replace many of today’ s essential uses of hydrocarbons. We need to be mindful of the economic, scientific, social and political realities of the energy transition.

“ Governments and the private sector must work together to pursue a transition that is both fair and just; we can not leave behind parts of society, or entire countries in developing markets, as we pursue the path to a low-carbon world. ”

However, the reasoning to withdraw from riskier investments has become clear, Fink said in the letter.

“ Climate change is almost invariably the top issue that clients around the world raise with BlackRock, ” he wrote. “ From Europe to Australia, South America to China, Florida to Oregon, investors are asking how they should modify their portfolios. And because capital markets pull future risk forward, we will see changes in capital allocation more quickly than we see changes to the climate itself…

“ In the near future — and sooner than most anticipate — there will be a significant reallocation of capital, ” he said. “ The evidence on climate risk is compelling investors to reassess core assumptions about modern finance…Even if only a fraction of the science is right today, this is a much more structural, long-term crisis. ”

More fund offerings also are to focus on environmental, social and governance ( ESG) initiatives.

BlackRock intends to double ESG exchange-traded fund offerings to 150 over the next few years, “ including sustainable versions of flagship index products, so that clients have more choice for how to invest their money. ”

The dynamic “ will accelerate as the next generation takes the helm of government and business ” as CEOs and chief investment officers ( CIO), Fink wrote. “ As trillions of dollars shift to millennials over the next few decades, as they become CEOs and CIOs, as they become the policymakers and heads of state, they will further reshape the world’ s approach to sustainability. ”

BlackRock earlier this month joined Climate Action 100+, a group of asset managers pushing fossil fuel producers to detail how they plan to meet carbon dioxide reduction targets laid out in the 2015 United Nations ( UN) global climate accord. In 2019, the group pressured BP plc to describe how its strategy aligned with those goals, and last May, almost all shareholders ( 99%) voted in favor to mesh goals with the UN agreement.

BlackRock’ s “ investment conviction is that sustainability and climate-integrated portfolios can provide better risk-adjusted returns to investors, ” Fink said. “ And with the impact of sustainability on investment returns increasing, we believe that sustainable investing is the strongest foundation for client portfolios going forward. ”

The world is “ facing the ultimate long-term problem, ” wrote Fink. “ We don’ t yet know which predictions about the climate will be most accurate, nor what effects we have failed to consider. But there is no denying the direction we are heading. Every government, company and shareholder must confront climate change. ”

Also Tuesday, the Global Association of Risk Professionals ( GARP) said it has launched a certificate in sustainability and climate risk to help professionals understand and manage the potential economic and operational impacts of a changing climate on their organizations.

“ As businesses start to recognize climate change as a financial risk, managers will increasingly need to add climate risk management to their skill sets — not only those working in finance but also in disciplines such as supply chain management, operations and technology, ” said GARP Risk Institute Co-President Jo Paisley.

244,Cybercriminals flooding the web with coronavirus-themed spam and malware,"There has been a sustained effort by cybercriminals to use the global concern about coronavirus to spread malware, steal credentials and perform massive spam operations since the end of January.
As the death toll has risen well past 1,000 and the virus continues to spread to more countries, hackers have expanded and evolved their coronavirus-themed attacks in a variety of ways.
A blog post from Proofpoint's senior director of threat research and detection, Sherrod Degrippo, on Thursday said hackers were now using conspiracy theories about the virus to sell fake cures or convince people to click on malicious links.
Cybercriminals were already using convincing but fake emails from the WHO, CDC and Japanese government to trick people into downloading PDF, MP4 and Microsoft Word DOCX files.
As the weeks have gone by, hackers have also expanded their attacks to include malware like Emotet and AZORult as well as information stealing malware like AgentTesla Keylogger and the NanoCore RAT.
Degrippo said Proofpoint researchers have also seen attacks targeting other industries like construction, education, energy, healthcare, retail, and transportation. Many of these attacks are targeting people in the United States as well as populations in Japan, Australia and Italy.

The shipping and manufacturing industry have taken massive hits because of the quarantines in China, and cybercriminals have sought to exploit that by bombarding companies with malware, spam and fake emails with links to sites like Office 365, Adobe and DocuSign hoping to steal emails and passwords.
One of the ways hackers have sought to attack enterprises is through emails purporting to come from an organization's president or someone's boss. The emails come with company letterhead and can generally seem like something a company's leader would send out. `` We have seen a campaign that uses a coronavirus-themed email that is designed to look like an internal email from the company's president to all employees shown. This email is extremely well-crafted and lists the business ' president's correct name, '' Degrippo wrote. `` The messages contain a Microsoft Word attachment with an embedded URL that leads to a fake Microsoft Office website to enter credentials. Once the credentials are entered, the user is then redirected to the legitimate World Health Organization coronavirus information site, making the phishing transaction seem legitimate. '' Proofpoint also found emails coming from fake Australian healthcare companies attempting the same scams. Avishay Zawoznik, security research manager at Imperva, released a detailed report on spam operations centered around coronavirus fears and showed how cybercriminals were exploiting online interest in the virus to spread misinformation or lure people into buying fake cures. The report includes two graphs showing clear links between the rise in Google searches for coronavirus and the number of bot requests for the term. `` For people searching for genuine information on coronavirus, this is polluting their online search results with fake and meaningless results. Not only does the content of this spam do nothing to help people in their quest to educate themselves on this global health risk, but bot operators are using technology to exploit the public's need for medical information in order to gain a few more clicks to their fake pharmacies, '' Zawoznik wrote. Hackers are spamming the comment sections of popular websites hoping to trick people into clicking on links and to improve the ranking of websites related to the term `` coronavirus. '' The expansion in diversity of cyberattacks against industries like manufacturing, retail and transportation have prompted the government to step in with guidelines. On Monday, a consumer education specialist for the Federal Trade Commission, Colleen Tressler, wrote that scammers are `` setting up websites to sell bogus products, and using fake emails, texts, and social media posts as a ruse to take your money and get your personal information. '' `` The emails and posts may be promoting awareness and prevention tips, and fake information about cases in your neighborhood. They also may be asking you to donate to victims, offering advice on unproven treatments, or contain malicious email attachments, '' she wrote. Tressler detailed a number of ways people can keep themselves safe from attacks, including up-to-date anti-virus and anti-malware software. She also said people should be wary of links to sources you don't know, any emails about vaccinations or cures and donation websites. `` The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC) is warning people about online promotions, including on social media, claiming that the products or services of publicly traded companies can prevent, detect, or cure coronavirus and that the stock of these companies will dramatically increase in value as a result, '' Tressler added.

Both the US and the EU are each other’ s largest export markets, with total trade reaching $ 5.33bn ( €4.66bn) in 2018, creating jobs and investment on both sides of the Atlantic.
But tariffs – such as those introduced over the Boeing / Airbus subsidies battles​​ and those threatened over France’ s tech tax – are a concern for the industry.
Signed by Comité Européen des Entreprises Vins ( CEEV) in Europe and Wine Institute in the US, the statement of principle on trade and tariffs asks governments refrain from targeting wine with retaliatory tariffs in unrelated trade disputes.
It calls on the governments of the EU and US to preserve and strengthen the EU-US wine partnership by completely eliminating tariffs ( a concept known as “ zero for zero ”) and refraining from targeting wine in unrelated trade disputes ( “ wine for wine ”).
The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ( GATT) embraced “ zero for zero ” for certain products more than 20 years ago, leading to increased trade for those products that benefited from a zero tariff.
Jean-Marie Barillère, President of CEEV, said: “ A free wine trade environment is essential to preserve the longstanding efforts and investments of our wine companies.​
“ We urge authorities to protect our sector from being caught in the crossfire in unrelated trade disputes. ” ​
Robert P. “ Bobby ” Koch, President and CEO of Wine Institute, said: “ Export markets are a key growth opportunity for US wineries, but tariffs of any kind stand in the way. It is time for all governments to recognize the unique benefits of the wine trade and eliminate tariffs once and for all. ” ​
Additional signatories to the statement of principle will be announced in the future.",general

269,Islamic State replaces al-Qaeda as Enemy No. 1 in Sahel,"Hi, what are you looking for?
By
Published
Brutal attacks that have killed nearly 300 people in less than two months have propelled the Islamic State to the status of the Sahel's most-feared jihadist group, eclipsing al-Qaeda, experts say.
The vast fragile region on the southern rim of the Sahara has been battling an escalating insurgency by violent Islamists, beginning in Mali in 2012 and then spreading to Niger and Burkina Faso.
Until recently, groups under the banner of al-Qaeda were in the forefront of the bloodshed.
But their position has now been overtaken by an Islamic State ( IS) affiliate, providing the group with an image of resurgence in West Africa after its decline in Syria and Iraq.
`` The priority is the Islamic State in the Greater Sahara ( ISGS), '' French President Emmanuel Macron declared on Monday at a summit gathering France and its five Sahel allies -- Chad, Burkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania and Niger.
The ISGS `` has emerged as our main enemy, against whom we should focus our struggle, '' Burkina President Roch Marc Christian Kabore said on Facebook.
`` Everyone has probably underestimated the ISGS, '' said Mahamoudou Savadogo, a Burkinabe researcher at a Senegal-based think tank, CERADD.
`` There has been a major rise in ( its) power. ''
- Rise of ISGS -
The ISGS leapt to world prominence after an ambush near the village of Tongo Tongo in Niger in 2017 that claimed the lives of four US special forces and four Nigerien troops.
Its leader is Adnan Abu Walid al-Sahraoui, whose nom de guerre derives from his birthplace in the Western Sahara.
His history of militancy dates back to fighting in the Polisario Front, which aims to end Moroccan control over the Western Sahara.
He became a leader of the Movement for Oneness and Jihad in West Africa ( MUJAO), which then merged with a group led by one-eyed Algerian jihadist Mokhtar Belmokhtar, forming Al-Mourabitoun.
He then broke with Belmokhtar to declare allegiance to IS, which the group recognised in 2016.
Savadogo said that from then until 2018, the ISGS prepared the groundwork, recruiting followers and raising funds -- and putting down roots in a region where the borders of Burkina, Mali and Niger meet.
`` In 2019, they were ready, '' he said.
That time spent in training has led to the bloodiest attacks in the history of the insurgency in the Sahel, all of which have been carried out in a range of 200 kilometres ( 120 miles).
- Mounting toll -
In November, two clashes in Mali, at Tabankort and Indelimane, claimed the lives of 92 soldiers. In December, 42 people -- 35 of them civilian -- were killed in Arbinda in Burkina, and 71 in Inates, Niger. And on January 16, 89 troops were killed in Chinegodar, Niger.
According to UN figures, jihadist attacks in the three countries last year left 4,000 dead.
Defence experts say that spectacular ISGS strikes use the same tactics.
The target is typically a remote military base, which is attacked by dozens of jihadists arriving on swarms of motorbikes.
They cut off the camp's communications, pound the site with mortars, kill as many soldiers as possible and then disappear before the army can fully respond.
`` The latest attacks seem to show that the group has acquired skills in command, control and coordination that it didn't have before, with group leaders able to carry out major operations, '' a French military source said with concern.
- Hard core -
A security expert in the Malian capital Bamako said the ISGS, like other jihadist groups in the Sahel, uses `` ad hoc '' fighters to beef up its ranks.
`` For every trained, radicalised fighter, there are two or three proxies ( allies) who are hired just for the operation, '' the source said.
The hard core of ISGS is probably no more than 200- or 300-strong, specialists say.
`` They use poachers, criminals, traffickers '' with deep knowledge of the local terrain, Savadogo said.
The ISGS gets technical help from another IS affiliate, the Islamic State's West Africa Province ( ISWAP), said Matteo Puxton, an independent analyst who spoke on condition of using a pseudonym after receiving threats.
According to IS propaganda outlets, the ISGS was incorporated into ISWAP in mid-2019. ISWAP also has a dissident faction of Nigeria's ruthless Boko Haram.
`` IS headquarters has taken over the ISGS. You can see that in the propaganda, the technical skills, '' Puxton said.
`` The level of ISGS attacks which were carried out in 2015 has been transformed. Their operations are sophisticated, and for the first time in ( ISGS's) history, there are long videos, put together by IS's central propaganda unit, '' he said.
Jean-Herve Jezequel, head of the Sahel project at the International Crisis Group ( ICG) think tank, said IS was `` easy to flag as an enemy, given its reputation for violence -- in terms of image, you really have a perfect foil there. ''
But, in fact, this reflects the situation on the ground, where IS affiliates are on the rise, `` including in the former strongholds of al-Qaeda, '' he said.
The IS `` is flying high '' in the Sahel, he said.
`` The reasons are complex and hard to decipher, but stem in part from the fact that it gives lots of autonomy to the groups that join it. ''

288,3-D chess with ex-presidents back in war-torn C.Africa ahead of polls,"Hi, what are you looking for?
By
Published
The unexpected return of two former presidents to the Central African Republic, the main figures in a civil war that still bloodies the country despite an 11-month-old peace accord, has set the stage for high-stakes political chess ahead of elections in December.
Francois Bozize, who is under an international arrest warrant for his role in the conflict, returned from exile in Uganda in mid-December -- timing that would enable him to mount a presidential run under electoral rules.
Thousands of supporters from a section of the opposition to President Faustin-Archange Touadera turned up at a rally urging Bozize to run for the top job.
He has yet to meet with Touadera. Government spokesman Ange Maxime Kazagui said Bozize had returned `` in obscure conditions and has set conditions for a meeting '' with the president.
Meanwhile the man who overthrew Bozize in 2013, Michel Djotodia, is also back in the country.
Even though Djotodia may also have his sights set on the presidency, Touadera greeted him at the airport upon his arrival in Bangui on Friday.
These machinations are potentially explosive in a country where fighting is still claiming lives despite a peace accord signed last February.
More than two-thirds of the former French colony is still under the control of armed rebel groups fighting over its rich mineral resources.
Nathalia Dukhan, a CAR expert with the US anti-corruption group The Sentry, described Djotodia's return as `` planned and negotiated ''.
She added: `` The current government, already very unpopular, is showing that it has just one goal: ( Touadera's) re-election at any cost. ''
Bozize `` is still very popular... which directly threatens this re-election, '' Dukhan said.
Another analyst, who heads the Association of Central African Bloggers ( ABCA), goes further, seeing Djotodia's return as a deliberate move by Touadera.
`` This way, Touadera ensures he has the support of voters in areas under the influence of ( former rebels) thanks to Djotodia's support, '' Rosmon Zokoue said.
- Arrest warrant -
Bozize took power following a 2003 coup before being overthrown 10 years later by Djotodia, head of the mainly Muslim Seleka rebellion in the predominantly Christian country.
Vicious sectarian violence ensued between the Seleka and vigilante militias dominated by Christians and animists known as the anti-Balaka.
Djotodia resigned in January 2014, a month after a French-led military intervention ousted the Seleka from power.
After a transitional period, Touadera was elected president in 2016 but was unable to stop the fighting, despite the presence of a multinational UN force.
While Djotodia has avoided prosecution by Central African or international justice, Bozize's is a different story.
The UN imposed sanctions against him and CAR issued an international arrest warrant accusing him of crimes against humanity for allegedly stoking the violence.
Analyst Thierry Vircoulon said `` Bozize's legal situation is a lot more complicated '' and it was uncertain whether he would be eligible to run for president.
Moreover, the Touadera camp may not look kindly on a Bozize candidacy if the president's re-election is threatened -- a scenario that could inflame the campaign.
- 'Race against time ' -
`` With less than a year before the presidential election, all the political clans are engaged in a race against time, '' Dukhan said.
Some observers warn that while Bozize's ambitions are clear, Djotodia's intentions are anyone's guess.
He has said simply: `` The future belongs to God. ''
Meanwhile, Djotodia remains the political head of the CAR's main armed rebel group, the Popular Front for the Rebirth of the Central African Republic ( FPRC).
The group maintains control over the northeast of the country with violence including killings, looting and rapes, according to Lewis Mudge, Human Rights Watch's CAR director.
The run-up to the December elections is thus potentially explosive in a country still embroiled in a conflict despite a relative calm since the Khartoum accord last February.
`` It's a bad sign that Bozize can return to the political landscape despite the sanctions, '' Mudge said.
`` The same for Djotodia, who was head of the Seleka which committed war crimes and crimes against humanity. It shows that the cycle of impunity has not been broken. ''

We are in the midst of a secular bull market in equities that is getting stronger. People think about the market being the S & P 500, which broke out to new highs in 2013 and has been making its way higher since, but interestingly, many markets around the world are just breaking out of multi-year sideways, choppy markets. This includes many of the European markets, like France and Switzerland. Taiwan has made the first new high since 1997; Japan has made the first new high since 1991. So the breadth of the advance in stocks globally is expanding and more and more markets have joined the rally.
I 'm not saying the market can't pull back. I would fully expect you will see two to five per cent correction at some point over the next few weeks … But I do think the global economy is slowly beginning to reaccelerate. Markets have been anticipating over the last little while and I think 2020 is probably a pretty good year for stocks.

296,Japan confirms first case of new China coronavirus strain,"Japan has confirmed its first case of infection from the new China coronavirus that has killed one person and prompted a travel alert from the US state department.
A man in his 30s from Kanagawa prefecture, next to Tokyo, tested positive after being treated for pneumonia, Japan’ s health ministry said in a statement on Thursday.
The man had been to Wuhan, in central China, where there has been an outbreak of pneumonia believed to be caused by the new coronavirus strain, it said.
Officials in Wuhan said last weekend that 41 people had pneumonia caused by the virus and a 61-year-old man had died.
The US state department issued a health alert update on Wednesday about travel to the Wuhan region, urging citizens travelling in the region to avoid contact with animals and animal markets or products, among other precautions.
On Wednesday Thai health authorities said they were stepping up monitoring passengers arriving at airports ahead of the lunar new year holiday, when 800,000 Chinese tourists are expected to visit.
But officials said the virus was not considered highly contagious and just passing by or talking to patients would not be a concern.
However, the World Health Organisation has said the new virus could spread and has warned hospitals around the world.
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can cause infections ranging from the common cold to severe acute respiratory syndrome, Sars. Some of the virus types cause less serious disease, while some – such as the one that causes Middle East respiratory syndrome, Mers – are far more severe.
The Japanese patient returned from Wuhan this month with a fever and was hospitalised. He was released yesterday after the symptoms subsided, the health ministry said.
Common symptoms include a runny nose, headache, cough and fever. Shortness of breath, chills and body aches are associated with more dangerous kinds of coronaviruses.",general
305,Exhibition upgrade at Berlin villa where Holocaust was planned,"Hi, what are you looking for?
By
Published
The Berlin villa which hosted the 1942 Wannsee Conference, at which top Nazi officials finalised plans for the Holocaust, will on Sunday launch a new permanent exhibition aimed at attracting more visitors.
The House of the Wannsee Conference has been open as a memorial since 1992, but organisers hope the revamped exhibition will increase awareness of how Adolf Eichmann and fellow Nazis planned the extermination of Europe's Jews.
At a press conference on Thursday, museum director Hans-Christian Jasch said the new exhibition aimed `` to attract a wider audience '', in particular among pupils at Berlin schools.
`` Until now, the average duration of a visit has been 30 minutes... We are aiming for visitors to stay between 60 and 90 minutes, '' he added.
The previous exhibition, which was largely text-based, has been reworked entirely to become more didactic and interactive, Jasch said.
Museum directors also underlined the importance of efforts to increase Holocaust awareness against a backdrop of recent `` discussions over anti-Semitism and racism '' in Germany, he said.
German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas and Hungarian Holocaust survivor Eva Fahidi will attend Sunday's unveiling ceremony.
Located on the shores of the Wannsee lake just southwest of the German capital, the lavish villa was the site of a notorious meeting of 15 high-ranking Nazi officials on January 20, 1942.
Led by security chief Reinhard Heydrich and recorded by fellow SS officer Eichmann, the meeting formalised the technical, administrative and economic details of what was dubbed `` the final solution to the Jewish question ''.
At his trial in Jerusalem in 1961, Eichmann told the court that the participants had been served `` by butlers with cognac and other drinks '' as they plotted the genocide.
The Nazis killed six million Jews in the Holocaust -- more than a third of the world's Jewish population at the time.
Jews from all over Europe were systematically deported from mid-1942 to six death camps: Auschwitz-Birkenau, Belzec, Chelmno, Majdanek, Sobibor and Treblinka.
The opening of the new exhibition at Wannsee has been timed to coincide with the 75th anniversary of the liberation of the camps.

307,PepsiCo to get all its US electricity from renewable sources,"Sustainability has become intrinsically woven into the day-to-day operations of nearly all food and beverage companies in the U.S. Along with PepsiCo, Coca-Cola, Nestlé​, Mars Wrigley, Hershey, Walmart and Unilever are just a few of the companies that have announced some type of sustainability goal.
Along with the altruistic reasons, there is monetary motivation for companies to embrace sustainability through practices such as renewable energy, recyclable packaging or water conservation. According to Nielsen, 66% of all consumers are willing to pay more for sustainable brands. This figure is even higher for younger consumers, with 73% of millennials and 72% of Gen Zers agreeing to spend more for brands that incorporate sustainability into their operations.
As the spending power of younger shoppers increases and they start having families of their own, brands that are willing to make changes to their business model in the name of the environment could reap even greater long-term benefits through customer loyalty and additional sales.
PepsiCo has a long list of well-known brands such as Cheetos, Quaker, Tropicana, Aquafina and Mountain Dew. As a result, its decision to use electricity from renewable sources could benefit a wide range of products in PepsiCo's portfolio if the New York-based snacks and drinks company decided to use it as a marketing tool. Publicizing its latest commitment on packaging, through commercials and on social media could help distance itself from competitors who have yet to follow through on their pledge or are still some time away from reaching it.
AB InBev, the world's largest brewer, has pledged to secure 100% of its purchased electricity from renewable sources by 2025. Beer from facilities that meet this goal will have a `` 100% renewable energy '' symbol on the label. Currently, about half of its U.S operations ' purchased electricity comes from renewable sources.
With sustainability no longer a luxury, companies such as PepsiCo must not only embrace the practice but increasingly show they are following through on their pledge. Last year, Greenpeace tracked the follow through of companies with sustainability pledges — specifically those tied to deforestation. It found that `` not a single company was able to demonstrate meaningful effort to eradicate deforestation from its supply chain. '' However, several have 2020 goals, so they have about another year to demonstrate progress.
As climate change headlines become more common, the pressure will be on multi-billion companies to play their part and prove they are backing up words with concrete action. Companies like PepsiCo that get ahead of the curve on sustainability stand the best chance of avoiding a potential PR nightmare later on and even profiting financially as their competitors come under fire.

314,"BandPay to launch March 2020, building trust in music business ( Includes interview)","Hi, what are you looking for?
By
Published
The issue of how payments in the music industry should be handled has been a hot topic of discussion, and creators want to make sure their work is properly compensated in the complex webs of digital production, distribution, and marketing. A solution comes in the form of the BandPay platform.
The platform streamlines two-party agreements by setting up deadline-based milestones in a given project, and assigning payments to each milestone. This builds accountability and minimizes errors, especially with the feature that guarantees that funds are available to complete a transaction. It establishes trust by ensuring all parties, from musicians to producers to social media influencers, stick to their side of the agreement. Centralizing all payments in one platform is bound to revolutionize cost management and revenue maximization in the music business.
To learn more,, Digital Journal spoke with Co-CEO DeCarlos Garrison.
Digital Journal: What are the complexities around making payments within the music industry?
DeCarlos Garrison: The music business, especially if we’ re talking about the less formal sectors of the industry, run on relationships, and it’ s not unusual to have significant agreements that are sealed with just a handshake. Even if a group of collaborators put a contract together, it doesn’ t mean the payment process will go smoothly.
This more casual approach for work-for-hire or services like social media management means people can wind up in long-standing conflicts. This hurts creativity, not to mention ruins friendships. Almost everyone who works as an independent producer or as an artist or manager has a horror story about the project that cost them twice what it should have, all because someone didn’ t do what they promised or were paid to do. If you think of your music as a business, you’ ve got a lot of loss–or at least risk–built in the way things currently work. With the tiny margins many artists face when creating and releasing music, that’ s terrible economically.
DJ: What is the BandPay solution?
Garrison: We wanted to bring clarity to this mess and give people a way to collaborate that doesn’ t rely so heavily on trust and hope. If you connect payments to a real roadmap of how and when work will be completed, this solves many of these problems. We think our approach will increase the efficiency of collaboration, making sure people providing creative services get paid appropriately and that artists or managers hiring creative talent can control costs.
BandPay prompts users to come up with milestones for their project together, tying payment to the completion of these milestones. Both parties know the money is there; BandPay holds the funds until they are released by users. If disputes arise, we offer tools to resolve them. The process adds an extra layer of confidence into working together and we think this will lead to more people making better music with a lot less heartbreak.
DJ: How did you develop the technology?
Garrison: Gleb Teper, my co-founder, and I thought a lot about what would really make a difference for musicians, managers, and others in the music business. We had ambitions to develop a platform that supported artists and teams in a 360 way, from learning about the industry to distributing their music. But we realized there was one thing musicians always struggled with, and that was money and trust. We decided to go all in on payment.
As we developed BandPay, we wanted to keep things very simple. We studied existing technologies and built on them with our unique ideas to design a user experience that is simple, seamless and intuitive.
DJ: What are the key advantages of BandPay?
Garrison: The big advantages of BandPay over some other payment methods is the milestones feature, which is totally customizable to your project or agreement, and the fact you know the money is there and will be paid when milestones are met. It’ s as simple as more basic payment apps people already use, but it’ s designed to hold everyone accountable to really clear standards and expectations at the same time.
DJ: How have you addressed data privacy issues?
Garrison: We take data privacy very seriously. We respect the rights of our users and have taken all necessary precautions to ensure that BandPay facilitates transactions safely and securely without sacrificing the privacy of our users.

323,"Ken Starr, celebrity lawyer Dershowitz join Trump defense team","Hi, what are you looking for?
By
Published
Ken Starr, who was at the center of Bill Clinton's impeachment in the 1990s, and America's biggest celebrity lawyer Alan Dershowitz were announced Friday to be joining President Donald Trump's Senate impeachment defense.
The administration has yet to unveil the full team but confirmed that White House counsel Pat Cipollone will be lead lawyer, backed by Trump's personal attorney Jay Sekulow.
`` President Trump has done nothing wrong and is confident that this team will defend him, the voters, and our democracy from this baseless, illegitimate impeachment, '' the White House said in a statement Friday evening.
But where Cipollone is ultra-discreet, and rarely speaks on the record, Dershowitz and Starr will bring the legal world's equivalent of rock stardom when the trial begins on Tuesday.
US media reports said Starr, the special prosecutor in the 1998 Clinton impeachment saga, was joining the Trump legal team. He is a hero to many on the right, even if Clinton ultimately was acquitted in the Senate.
Among the first to react -- with expletive-laden astonishment -- was Monica Lewinsky, whose affair with Clinton was the subject of Starr's investigation.
`` This is definitely an 'are you fucking kidding me? ' kinda day, '' she tweeted.
No less controversial is the choice of Dershowitz, whose past clients include disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein, as well as film director Roman Polanski and former heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson, both embroiled in notorious rape cases.
Dershowitz himself has been accused of being a witness and participant in Epstein's sex crimes -- allegations he strenuously denies.
Dershowitz's most famous case was the successful defense of former NFL star O.J. Simpson, whose televised 1995 murder trial riveted the nation.
In the Senate, Dershowitz, who teaches at Harvard University, says he 'll be pursuing loftier matters.
In a post on Twitter Friday, Dershowitz said he would `` present oral arguments at the Senate trial to address the constitutional arguments against impeachment and removal. ''
Lead lawyer Cipollone is the author of the Republican president's uncompromising strategy to stonewall the Democrats ' impeachment investigation, calling it `` partisan and unconstitutional. ''
Another high-powered player will be Sekulow, a stalwart in the White House pushback against a two-year probe by special counsel Robert Mueller into Trump's controversial dealings with Russia.
A Supreme Court veteran and a big name on the right-wing evangelical Christian scene, he won't be dazzled by the bright lights of Washington's ultimate fight.
Rounding off the roster will be Robert Ray, another figure from the investigations into Clinton that rocked Washington in the 1990s, US media reported.
- Reliable Republican jurors -
Trump has been impeached by the House of Representatives on accusations that he abused his office to try and force Ukraine into digging up dirt on leading Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.
He was also impeached for allegedly obstructing Congress.
But the White House enters the Senate trial with a massive advantage: Trump's Republicans have 53 of the 100 seats and the party is in lockstep.
The majority leader, Senator Mitch McConnell, echoes Trump's claim that the impeachment is a political hit job.
- Trump's lawyers -
As a man who has been fighting legal battles for decades -- including rape allegations, multiple real estate disputes, and bankruptcy -- Trump is no stranger to colorful lawyers.
His former longtime attorney Michael Cohen is serving a three-year sentence and has turned on his old boss. Before going behind bars for a variety of crimes last year, Cohen called Trump a `` con man '' and a `` cheat. ''
Where Cohen left off, an even bigger firebrand, former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani, stepped in to serve as attorney and roving political fixer.
Giuliani's relentless attempts to prove conspiracy theories around Biden's family activities in Ukraine are interwoven with the whole impeachment case against Trump. Although Giuliani is not a government employee, he has traveled to Ukraine to lead the search for dirt on Biden.
And the outspoken former federal prosecutor who was in charge of New York on 9/11, has pushed to be allowed in on the Senate impeachment trial team. A wary White House has shut the door.
Friday evening, House Democrats released documents showing Lev Parnas, who served as Giuliani's envoy to Ukrainian officials, had been in extensive contact with an aide to Representative Devin Nunes, the highest-ranking Republican on the House Intelligence Committee.
The WhatsApp messages, which run from February to May of last year, indicate that Nunes's office was aware of the alleged efforts to try and force Ukraine into investigating Biden.
Parnas made headlines Thursday when, hours before Trump's impeachment trial opened, he broke ranks to charge that the president `` knew exactly what was going on '' regarding his and business partner Igor Fruman's efforts to influence Ukrainian authorities.
Trump denied knowing Parnas. `` I don't believe I 've ever spoken to him, '' he told reporters.
But Parnas told MSNBC that Trump was lying. `` We're not friends, '' the Ukrainain-born businessman said. `` But he knew exactly who we were. ''

359,Driving Down Methane Leaks from the Oil and Gas Industry – Analysis,"Sign In
Create a free IEA account to download our reports or subcribe to a paid service.
IEA ( 2021), Driving Down Methane Leaks from the Oil and Gas Industry, IEA, Paris https: //www.iea.org/reports/driving-down-methane-leaks-from-the-oil-and-gas-industry
Reducing methane emissions from oil and gas operations is among the most cost-effective and impactful actions that governments can take to achieve global climate goals. What’ s more, a growing number of jurisdictions recognise that regulatory action plays an important role alongside voluntary industry action.
Methane is a potent greenhouse gas with important implications for climate change. Although methane has a much shorter atmospheric lifetime than carbon dioxide ( CO2) – around 12 years, compared with centuries for CO2 – it absorbs much more energy while in the atmosphere. Thus, while methane tends to receive less attention than CO2, reducing energy-sector methane emissions will be critical for avoiding the worst effects of climate change.
The IEA estimates that the oil and gas sector emitted around 70 Mt of methane ( approximately 2.1 Gt CO2-eq) in 2020 – just over 5% of global energy-related greenhouse gas emissions. Early satellite data suggest that the incidence of large-scale leaks fell in 2020, although some of this likely stems from the major drops in production as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. Under the IEA Sustainable Development Scenario ( SDS), emissions from this sector will need to fall to around 20 Mt per year by 2030 – a drop of more than 70% from levels in 2020.
This 70% reduction coincides with the amount that would be technically possible to abate, according to the IEA Methane Tracker. In addition, a significant share of these emissions can be abated at no net cost, because the value of the captured methane is sufficient to cover the cost of the abatement measure, i.e. there should already be an economic incentive to avoid the release of this gas to the atmosphere. The precise share of emissions that can be avoided at no net cost will undoubtedly vary from year to year and from region to region, with the prevailing gas price being a key variable. Natural gas prices in 2020 were a lot lower around the world than in previous years, so the share of abatement that pays for itself is lower than in previous years. But it will pick up again as natural gas prices rise.
There are a number of voluntary, industry-led efforts to reduce methane emissions, and a number of individual companies have announced methane reduction targets in the past year. Nevertheless, an immediate and significant change in ambition is needed to achieve the sorts of reductions that would be consistent with international climate objectives. While industry efforts can and should continue, government policy and regulation will be critical to removing or mitigating obstacles that prevent companies from getting started and going further.
The IEA’ s country-specific methane cost curves suggest that a significant number of abatement measures would pay for themselves, provided that the captured gas can be delivered to market and sold at the going market rate. Although this simple cost analysis suggests that companies should be willing to undertake some of these actions voluntarily, this is not necessarily the case in practice. Understanding what prevents companies in different countries and market contexts from undertaking actions that appear to be cost-effective is a vital starting point in the design of a regulatory approach to methane abatement.
There are three main types of barrier that explain why companies are not taking full advantage of these opportunities: information, infrastructure and investment incentives.
Information
There is a significant information gap in many companies about methane, regarding both its environmental impacts and, more specifically, the level and sources of emissions from company operations. There is also a lack of awareness in many cases about the abatement technologies that exist, their costs, and the benefits of capturing and using or selling gas that would otherwise be emitted. Even if senior management is aware of the risk of methane releases, this may not be reflected in the broader company culture and its operating practices so that the personnel on the ground, who are in a position to take action, are not doing so. Often this lack of information is an oversight; however, existing policies may also create a disincentive to obtaining full knowledge. For instance, in a jurisdiction that charges emitters a fee or tax based on volume of pollution emitted, companies may fear raising their compliance costs if they discover new sources of methane.
Infrastructure
In many cases, captured gas can be easily brought to market. However, in other cases, particularly where gas is co‑produced ( or “ associated ”) with oil, existing pathways or businesses may not exist to bring the gas to productive use. In these cases, it may be necessary to construct new infrastructure to bring the gas to a consumer, including new compression equipment, gathering pipelines and transmission pipelines, or liquefaction facilities. Methane abatement may falter without policies that require or incentivise productive use of natural gas.
Investment incentives
While context matters for corporate decision-making, all firms have limited capital to deploy. Thus, opportunities to invest in methane reduction must compete with other investment opportunities. Even where abatement is cost-effective, companies may opt to direct capital towards investments where a higher rate of return is possible. Moreover, abatement may seem less cost-effective as long as the environmental costs of pollution are not factored into the investment calculation. In addition, where the owner of the gas is not the owner of transmission infrastructure, there may be an issue of “ split incentives, ” whereby the pipeline company that pays to repair leaks sees the benefits accrue to the owner of the gas, from additional throughput. Finally, state-owned firms may not directly benefit from cost-saving measures because they return earnings to the government treasury, and then receive pre‑determined appropriations to cover operations.
Governments can address many of these barriers with policy and regulatory tools. If information poses a barrier, policies could include educational strategies, such as trainings; certificate programmes for workers; measures on monitoring, reporting and verification of emissions; reference to international voluntary corporate reporting standards; or initiatives to encourage knowledge-sharing and best practices. With respect to infrastructure, governments might introduce requirements in the planning stages of projects, directly invest in building new infrastructure or adopt policies that allow spreading of the development costs across multiple firms and end users. Governments may also be able to price environmental externalities or create financial incentives for onsite use of captured gas, expenditures in abatement technologies, or repair transmission equipment to remove barriers to investment.
The aim of these interventions is twofold. First, they can unlock the abatement measures that are already economically advantageous today, i.e. the methane leaks that can, in our view, be abated at no net cost. Second, they can facilitate and encourage actions that address the range of methane emissions that are technically possible to abate, i.e. the 70% reductions that are achieved in the Sustainable Development Scenario by 2030. To reach this level, it will not be enough to simply remove the barriers that prevent companies from acting on their own. Broader regulatory initiatives also have an important role to play. Firms are increasingly recognising this and are expressing interest in “ sound methane policies and regulations that incentivise early action, drive performance improvements, facilitate proper enforcement, and support flexibility and innovation. ” 1
Regulations calibrated to each jurisdiction’ s specific goals will be critical to ensuring that companies undertake the appropriate abatement actions alongside voluntary action by companies. There are many types of regulations, but what they all have in common is that they can fundamentally change the cost-benefit analysis for firms and drive them to internalise the societal cost of that pollution.
This report aims to provide a complete “ getting started ” guide for policy makers looking to develop new regulations to tackle oil and gas methane emissions within their jurisdictions. This guide consists of two companion pieces: a Regulatory Roadmap and a Regulatory Toolkit.
The Roadmap focuses on the process of establishing a new regulation. It details ten key steps in developing a new regulation and provides a step-by-step guide to aid regulators in gathering the information they need to design, draft and implement an effective regulatory scheme.
The Toolkit focuses on the content of methane regulations. It characterises the different regulatory approaches that are currently in use for methane, with appropriate links to the IEA Policies Database for specific examples. The aim of the Toolkit is to provide regulators with an encyclopedia of the different regulatory tools that are available to them as they craft new policies.
The IEA has identified ten steps that will assist regulators in selecting a regulatory approach and implementing a set of effective methane policies that match the local situation. Although presented sequentially here, these steps may be carried out in a different order, may take place concurrently, or may even be repeated once new data on emissions or new technologies become available.
A ten-step roadmap for policy makers
Step 1: Understand the legal and political context
Step 2: Characterise the nature of your industry
Step 3: Develop an emissions profile
Step 4: Build regulatory capacity
Step 5: Engage stakeholders
Step 6: Define regulatory objectives
Step 7: Select the appropriate policy design
Step 8: Draft the policy
Step 9: Enable and enforce compliance
Step 10: Periodically review and refine your policy
Across these steps, the process of implementing a new regulation unfolds in three distinct phases. The first phase takes place before any formal development of a regulatory proposal. It consists of an information-gathering exercise designed to equip policy makers with an understanding of how best to match policies and regulations to the institutional circumstances, existing regulatory framework, market context and emissions profile of the jurisdiction. This information-gathering phase corresponds to the first three steps of the Roadmap.
Once policy makers have gathered this information, the next phase involves designing and developing the regulatory proposal, taking care to enhance institutional capacity and engage with internal and external stakeholders. This regulatory development phase corresponds to Steps 4 through 8 of the Roadmap. At this stage, regulators should also consider the examples of different regulatory approaches that are collected in the Toolkit.
Even after a regulation is published, a great deal of work remains to ensure that it operates effectively. In the implementation phase, policy makers will need to assure compliance with requirements and develop a plan to update the regulation as needed. This corresponds to Steps 9 and 10. Note that although implementation does not begin until a regulation is finalised, policy makers should consider these steps at the drafting stage to build in compliance assurance and adaptive strategies from the start.
A growing number of jurisdictions have already recognised that regulatory action plays an important role in driving these actions in the oil and gas industry. Some governments have taken action; others have pledged to follow in the coming years. From our survey of early actions, we have developed a typology of regulatory approaches designed to demystify the complex web of regulations that exists in many countries. An introduction to this typology is outlined below, and the Toolkit section of this report provides specific examples for each approach.
Typology of regulatory approaches
The regulatory approaches that have been applied to methane can be categorised into four main types of regulatory approaches:
The table below illustrates each regulatory approach by describing its application to the replacement of “ high-bleed ” pneumatic controllers. These controllers, used for a variety of purposes across the oil and gas value chain, can represent a significant share of the industry’ s methane releases. For instance, according to the US greenhouse gas emissions inventory, emissions from these pieces of equipment represented about 25% of methane emissions from petroleum and natural gas systems in the United States.2
Regulatory approach
Definition
Example
Prescriptive
Prescriptive instruments direct regulated entities to undertake or not to undertake specific actions or procedures.
Operator is directed to replace pneumatic controllers with lower-emitting controllers by a certain date.
Performance- or outcome-based
Performance-based instruments establish a mandatory performance standard for regulated entities but do not dictate how the target must be achieved.
Operator is directed to achieve facility-wide methane reductions from a baseline. The operator then decides to replace the highest-emitting controllers because it is most cost-effective to target these pieces of equipment to meet the overall target.
Economic
Economic instruments induce action by applying penalties or introducing financial incentives for certain behaviours. This may include taxes, subsidies, or market-based approaches such as tradable emissions permits or credits.
Operator must pay a pollution tax for emissions. Alternatively, the operator may deduct the costs of replacing high-emitting equipment from its tax liabilities. Under either scenario, the operator may choose to replace the controller for financial reasons.
Information-based
Information-based instruments are designed to improve the state of information about emissions, and may include requirements that regulated entities estimate, measure and report their emissions to public bodies.
Operator is directed to report emissions of known high-emitting equipment or activities. In view of the volume quantified, the operator may choose to reduce rather than disclose emissions associated with pneumatic controllers.
Most jurisdictions with methane-specific oil and natural gas regulations have relied heavily on prescriptive requirements to achieve emissions reductions. This “ command and control ” approach focuses on directing the installation or replacement of specific pieces of equipment. For example, if a jurisdiction determines that many of its routine emissions come from “ high-bleed ” pneumatic valve controllers used across the oil and natural gas value chain, a prescriptive rule could direct operators to replace existing controllers with “ low-bleed ” or “ no-bleed ” alternatives, and prohibit installation of high-bleed equipment at new facilities.
National policies Provincial/state-level policies only
Definitions for each type of instrument can be found in the Policy Type Definitions section of this report. This table reflects entries in the IEA Policies Database as of 18 January 2020. We welcome feedback from jurisdictions regarding any updates to existing policies or on additional policies that are missing from the database.
By contrast, performance- or outcome-based requirements require firms to meet a specific emissions target for a specific piece of equipment or facility, but they do not specify how the firm must meet that target. For example, Mexico’ s 2018 regulation requires operators of existing facilities to establish and achieve six-year emissions reduction goals for each facility. Operators required to reduce emissions will look for the most cost-effective repairs and replacements across each facility. If some “ high-bleed ” controllers are contributing heavily to the overall emissions profile of the facility and can easily be replaced, operators will replace these controllers.
National policies Provincial/state-level policies only

We welcome feedback from jurisdictions regarding any updates to existing policies or on additional policies that are missing from the database.
Some jurisdictions may opt to use economic instruments that deploy penalties or incentives to induce action. The simplest form of economic regulation would be a tax on emissions of methane. For the given example, this would in essence encourage a firm to “ replace valve controllers or pay for the methane that they emit. ” In response, an operator might prefer to replace the higher-emitting controllers rather than pay a methane tax. Norway’ s carbon tax, which covers methane emissions from offshore oil and gas facilities, represents this approach.
In contrast to policies that assess a penalty of sorts for emitting methane, a government may offer inducements or economic incentives to encourage abatement. An incentive rule might state, “ If you replace a valve controller, you can deduct the cost of the replacement from the royalties owed to the state. ” For example, Nigeria allows companies to deduct capital expenditures on equipment to capture associated gas from its profits, and to deduct royalties assessed on associated gas that is sold and delivered downstream.

We welcome feedback from jurisdictions regarding any updates to existing policies or on additional policies that are missing from the database.
One of the biggest hurdles to effective regulation of methane from the energy sector is the extent of uncertainty – about the magnitude of emissions, emissions sources and variability. Given this, a particularly fruitful approach might be information-based requirements. A rule might require firms to “ tag all high-emitting valve controllers and submit monthly reports on their emissions. ” For some operators, this may provide new insight into the magnitude of their emissions. Once they learn how much they are emitting, they may take voluntary action. If these emissions reports must be made public, this may also give rise to pressure on operators to reduce emissions from external stakeholders.

Many examples of these regulatory approaches are already in place. This guide relies heavily on these examples, drawn from the IEA Policies Database and categorised according to standardised Policy Type Definitions, in order to point regulators to real-world examples of these existing policy tools and related resources. These examples should be a primary resource for regulators following this guide, providing a source of inspiration and illustrating best practices.
Policy makers that have already established methane regulations have learned a great deal. This guide seeks to share those best practices and lessons learned in order to maximise the effectiveness of new regulations.
Policy and regulation can help countries meet emissions goals
Policy makers should not assume that the industry has the right incentives to stimulate voluntary action sufficient to address the methane problem. As noted above, a growing number of jurisdictions have recognised the importance of sound policy and regulation alongside voluntary action by industry. Even if industry may take some action on its own, not all of the necessary reductions will be cost-effective on their own, and policy and regulation can work to fundamentally change company incentives in this regard.
There are no one-size-fits-all solutions
A policy and regulatory regime will be most effective if it is tailored to a jurisdiction’ s local situation, including the political and regulatory context, the nature of the industry, the size and location of emissions sources, and the jurisdiction’ s policy goals. Different regulatory approaches have particular advantages and disadvantages that depend on circumstances that will vary across jurisdictions, and policy makers should take the time up front to understand how these circumstances play out within the local context. The steps outlined in the Roadmap are designed to help regulators understand these circumstances and make decisions on which approaches fit their situation best.
Better information can enable more efficient regulatory requirements
Performance-based requirements and economic instruments can produce more economically efficient outcomes by enabling an operator to identify the most cost-effective abatement options. However, these approaches often require a robust measurement and reporting regime to function properly. For instance, a methane tax can not be effectively enforced if no one knows how much methane is being emitted. Developing and implementing a robust measurement and reporting regime may take several years. For jurisdictions in the early stages of regulating methane, prescriptive standards may be the best option until a robust measurement and reporting regime is in place.
However, countries do not need to wait for better data to take action
Fortunately, prescriptive requirements can be effective at reducing emissions in their own right. Moreover, they can serve as a useful first step on the path to more flexible and economically efficient regulations because they are relatively simple to administer and do not require an accurate baseline understanding of the level of emissions or a robust measurement and estimation regime. Therefore, a starting point for jurisdictions regulating methane for the first time might be to combine prescriptive requirements on known `` problem '' sources with a monitoring programme that detects `` super‑emitters '' using satellite or inspection data and requires companies to address them as they arise. Over time, it may be possible to incorporate aspects of other approaches into a primarily prescriptive regime, such as broad facility or company level targets that complement other requirements.
Critically, this path is well worn. Policy tools adequate to address methane emissions already exist, in one form or another. Regulators following this guide and drawing on the different resources available will be equipped with the information needed to decide among the available approaches, and ultimately, to execute that vision.
This guide is divided into two main components, the Roadmap and the Toolkit. The Regulatory Roadmap treats in detail each of the ten steps highlighted above and identifies key considerations and decision points for each step. The steps are presented sequentially, but will generally prove to be modular, with feedback loops and iterations between different stages of policy making. Feel free to focus on the steps that you have greatest interest in and skip steps that you have already mastered.
Next, the Regulatory Toolkit presents different elements of policy making to support regulators throughout the policy development and implementation phases. It discusses general regulatory strategies, providing further detail on the four general regulatory approaches described above and illustrating their use through examples of current methane regulations. As with the Roadmap steps, each topic is intended to be modular and stand-alone, and you may wish to refer to aspects of the Toolkit as you walk through the Roadmap steps.

368,CDC takes steps to screen for new coronavirus at some airports,"Hi, what are you looking for?
By
Published
On Friday, The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC) began screening passengers who had traveled from Wuhan, China at San Francisco, New York’ s John F. Kennedy, and Los Angeles international airports for symptoms of a new coronavirus, reports The Hill.
Around 100 additional staff were deployed to the three airports to supplement existing staff at CDC quarantine stations. The CDC warned that its response could change as it learns more from its investigation of the virus. Scientists around the world are studying its genome sequence in the effort to understand it.
The coronavirus is in the same family of those causing the deadly severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS), and the Middle East respiratory syndrome ( MERS), however, it seems to be less lethal, according to CTV News Canada.
As of January 11, 2019, Wuhan officials said 41 patients have been diagnosed with nCoV pneumonia, and two have been discharged from the hospital. Seven had severe infections, and one patient died. The rest are listed in stable condition.
Most of the patients, but not all of them, reportedly visited the large seafood and animal market in Wuhan, China. The fact that some people did not visit the market suggests some limited person-to-person spread may be occurring, according to the CDC. At the same time, though, the agency says the risk of transmission for the American public is “ currently deemed to be low. ”
As of Saturday, three travelers – two now back in Thailand and one in Japan who visited Wuhan – but not the market – have been infected with the coronavirus, suggesting human-to-human transmission may be possible.
Genetic findings Chinese scientists submitted the coronavirus gene sequencing data for posting on Virological.org, a hub for prepublication data designed to assist with public health activities and research. The post was communicated by Edward Holmes, Ph.D., with the University of Sydney, on behalf of a Chinese group led by Yong-Zhen Zhang, Ph.D., with Fudan University in Shanghai.
Vineet Menachery, Ph.D., with the University of Texas Medical Branch ( UTMB) said on Twitter that the Wuhan nCoV appears to be a group 2B coronavirus, which puts it in the same family as the SARS ( severe acute respiratory syndrome) virus.
There is still much testing to do, although scientists are aware of the fact that bat viruses span coronavirus diversity and bats are a dominant host in much of the evolutionary history.
However, Andrew Rambaut, Ph.D., administrator of Virological.org and professor of molecular evolution at the University of Edinburgh says that while the Muhan nCoV is 89 percent similar to SARS-related bat coronavirus in the Sarbecovirus group of beta coronaviruses – ” that doesn’ t mean it comes from bats. MERS-CoV is 88 percent identical to the nearest known bat virus, and MERS is endemic in camels. ”

370,Major Asian markets mostly rise as China keeps its loan prime rate unchanged,"Stocks in major Asian markets were mostly higher on Monday, with the People's Bank of China ( PBoC) keeping the loan prime rate ( LPR) unchanged.
Mainland Chinese stocks saw gains on the day, with the Shanghai composite up 0.66% to about 3,095.79 while the Shenzhen composite was 1.311% higher at around 1,829.95. The Shenzhen component also gained 1.47% to 11,115.88.
Shares of Chinese drugmakers and facial mask firms also surged amid concerns over a coronavirus outbreak in the the country. Jiangsu Sihuan Bioengineering and Shandong Lukang Pharmaceutical saw their stock surge by about 10%, their daily movement limit. Meanwhile, facial mask maker Shanghai Dragon also soared around 10%.
The Hang Seng index in Hong Kong, however, slipped 0.6% as of its final hour of trading.
The moves came as the People's Bank of China kept the one year and five year loan prime rates unchanged for January.
`` We still expect some changes to the LPR at some point this year, even though we're not seeing that as early as like the first month of the year right now, '' Kevin Leung, executive director of investment strategy at Haitong International Securities, told CNBC's `` Street Signs '' on Monday.
`` The phase one of the trade deal has been... signed right now, so i think ( the Chinese authorities) would take a few months to see if anything is going on or if there's any further improvements made or if there's any deterioration in... the second phase when that happens, '' Leung said. `` If there's any more stimulus policies coming in, I think it will be coming in the second quarter of the year. ''
In Japan, the Nikkei 225 rose 0.18% to close at 24,083.51 despite shares of index heavyweight Fast Retailing falling 1.58%. The Topix index also advanced 0.5% to finish its trading day at 1,744.16.

371,A glance at the new coronavirus outbreak in China,"BEIJING – Chinese authorities and the World Health Organization say a new strain of coronavirus is behind the outbreak of pneumonia in the central city of Wuhan, which has erupted just ahead of the Lunar New Year, the country’ s biggest festival.
Health officials say the strain does not appear as lethal as some other strains of coronavirus such as severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS), which killed nearly 800 people worldwide during a 2002-03 outbreak that also originated from China.
As of Jan. 19, there were 65 confirmed cases of patients with pneumonia caused by the new strain of coronavirus. All patients were either Wuhan residents or people who recently went to the city. Their symptoms included fever, cough and difficulty breathing.
Of the 62 patients in Wuhan itself, two have died and 19 have been discharged.
Thailand has also reported two confirmed cases of the pneumonia, both of whom were Chinese tourists from Wuhan. Japan has also confirmed one case of a Japanese citizen who visited Wuhan.
Chinese authorities says the outbreak is strongly linked to a seafood market in Wuhan, but some patients diagnosed with the new coronavirus deny exposure to this market.
Health officials say there is no clear evidence that the virus spreads easily from one person to another, but they can not completely rule out the possibility of human-to-human transmission.
Wuhan municipal authorities released information about a married couple who contracted the virus on Jan. 15. The husband, who got sick first, worked at the market, but the wife denied any exposure to the market.
The authorities did not explicitly state whether this was a case of human-to-human transmission.
There is no vaccine for the new virus. Symptoms include fever, difficulty in breathing as well as pneumonic infiltrates in the lungs.
Chinese authorities have stepped up monitoring and disinfection efforts ahead of the lunar new year holiday in late January, when many of the country’ s 1.4 billion people will travel domestically and overseas.
Airport authorities in the United States as well as many Asian countries, including Japan, Thailand, Singapore and South Korea, have stepped up screening of passengers from Wuhan.
The World Health Organization sent directives to hospitals around the world on infection prevention and control. It has advised against travel or trade restrictions based on available information, however.",tech
377,Deadly Mystery Virus Reported in 2 New Chinese Cities and South Korea,"BEIJING — The authorities in China reported a third death from a mysterious virus and more than 130 new cases over the weekend, including ones found in Beijing and southern China for the first time. One new case was also reported in South Korea on Monday.
The jump in cases raised questions about how the virus is being transmitted and added to concerns about the spread of the illness ahead of China’ s busiest travel season.
The health commission in Wuhan, a central Chinese city where the virus originated last month, said early Monday that 136 new cases had been detected on Saturday and Sunday, including one who died. Nine patients in the city remained critically ill.
Two new cases were reported in Beijing, and one in Shenzhen, a booming metropolis in the south, near Hong Kong. That brought the total number of cases in China to around 200, more than double the number reported just a day earlier.
The latest cases come amid growing concern among some experts that the outbreak could be more severe than China’ s government has described.
[ Read: What we know about China’ s new coronavirus. ]
The virus already appears to have spread outside China, with the authorities in South Korea reporting on Monday that a Chinese woman who arrived at the Incheon International Airport on Sunday from Wuhan had tested positive for the illness. Last week, three cases were reported in Thailand and Japan involving people who had traveled through Wuhan.
And with hundreds of millions of people in China expected to travel for the Lunar New Year holiday, which begins Friday, public health officials are working to stop a major outbreak.
On Sunday, China’ s central government sought to reassure the public that it had the situation under control. In Beijing’ s most extensive remarks on the outbreak since it began last month, the National Health Commission said that experts agreed that an epidemic was “ still preventable and controllable. ”
Still, the commission acknowledged that the source of the virus and its path of transmission were not fully understood.
“ The mutation of the virus still needs to be closely monitored, ” the statement said.
Of the new patients found in Wuhan over the weekend, 66 were men and 70 women, and their ages ranged from 25 to 89, the health commission reported on Monday. It said that they mostly had symptoms such as fever, coughing and difficulty breathing.
Most people with the infection have contracted it through exposure to animals at a market in Wuhan that sells seafood and live animals, the authorities say. But the health commission in Wuhan said on Sunday that some people who had come down with the virus had no exposure to the market.
That acknowledgment raises the possibility that the virus could be present in other markets in Wuhan, experts said, adding to fears that more people might be at risk.
“ If you can not find the source and control the source of the virus, you can not extinguish the fire, ” said David Hui, the director of the Stanley Ho Center for Emerging Infectious Diseases at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.
Dr. Hui said the risk of the virus spreading from human to human on a broad scale appeared to be low, though he noted that the virus could mutate.
The World Health Organization said on Sunday that while its analysis indicated that limited transmission of the virus is possible, it remained unclear whether it can easily spread from one person to another. The group said it would continue to examine the issue.
“ We do not have enough evidence to evaluate the full extent of human-to-human transmission, ” its Manila office said.
Some experts have suggested that there are probably far more cases of the illness than the authorities have disclosed. In previous incidents, like the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, the Chinese government withheld critical information.
One estimate by researchers at Imperial College London suggested on Friday that there could now be as many as 1,700 cases of the new virus.
The W.H.O. said on Sunday that China could potentially confirm more cases in the coming days and weeks as more people were screened for it.

Touching contaminated objects and then infecting ourselves with the germs is not typically how the virus spreads. But it can happen. A number of studies of flu, rhinovirus, coronavirus and other microbes have shown that respiratory illnesses, including the new coronavirus, can spread by touching contaminated surfaces, particularly in places like day care centers, offices and hospitals. But a long chain of events has to happen for the disease to spread that way. The best way to protect yourself from coronavirus — whether it’ s surface transmission or close human contact — is still social distancing, washing your hands, not touching your face and wearing masks.
So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited paper published in April suggests that people are most infectious about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms. Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have symptoms was “ very rare, ” but she later walked back that statement.
A study by European scientists is the first to document a strong statistical link between genetic variations and Covid-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus. Having Type A blood was linked to a 50 percent increase in the likelihood that a patient would need to get oxygen or to go on a ventilator, according to the new study.
The unemployment rate fell to 13.3 percent in May, the Labor Department said on June 5, an unexpected improvement in the nation’ s job market as hiring rebounded faster than economists expected. Economists had forecast the unemployment rate to increase to as much as 20 percent, after it hit 14.7 percent in April, which was the highest since the government began keeping official statistics after World War II. But the unemployment rate dipped instead, with employers adding 2.5 million jobs, after more than 20 million jobs were lost in April.
Mass protests against police brutality that have brought thousands of people onto the streets in cities across America are raising the specter of new coronavirus outbreaks, prompting political leaders, physicians and public health experts to warn that the crowds could cause a surge in cases. While many political leaders affirmed the right of protesters to express themselves, they urged the demonstrators to wear face masks and maintain social distancing, both to protect themselves and to prevent further community spread of the virus. Some infectious disease experts were reassured by the fact that the protests were held outdoors, saying the open air settings could mitigate the risk of transmission.
Exercise researchers and physicians have some blunt advice for those of us aiming to return to regular exercise now: Start slowly and then rev up your workouts, also slowly. American adults tended to be about 12 percent less active after the stay-at-home mandates began in March than they were in January. But there are steps you can take to ease your way back into regular exercise safely. First, “ start at no more than 50 percent of the exercise you were doing before Covid, ” says Dr. Monica Rho, the chief of musculoskeletal medicine at the Shirley Ryan AbilityLab in Chicago. Thread in some preparatory squats, too, she advises. “ When you haven’ t been exercising, you lose muscle mass. ” Expect some muscle twinges after these preliminary, post-lockdown sessions, especially a day or two later. But sudden or increasing pain during exercise is a clarion call to stop and return home.
States are reopening bit by bit. This means that more public spaces are available for use and more and more businesses are being allowed to open again. The federal government is largely leaving the decision up to states, and some state leaders are leaving the decision up to local authorities. Even if you aren’ t being told to stay at home, it’ s still a good idea to limit trips outside and your interaction with other people.
Common symptoms include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath. Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less common. The C.D.C. has also added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.
If air travel is unavoidable, there are some steps you can take to protect yourself. Most important: Wash your hands often, and stop touching your face. If possible, choose a window seat. A study from Emory University found that during flu season, the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window, as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people. Disinfect hard surfaces. When you get to your seat and your hands are clean, use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest, the seatbelt buckle, the remote, screen, seat back pocket and the tray table. If the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather, you can wipe that down, too. ( Using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them.)
Taking one’ s temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds, as “ normal ” temperature numbers can vary, but generally, keep an eye out for a temperature of 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit or higher. If you don’ t have a thermometer ( they can be pricey these days), there are other ways to figure out if you have a fever, or are at risk of Covid-19 complications.
The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now, the C.D.C., like the W.H.O., has advised that ordinary people don’ t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’ t replace hand washing and social distancing.
If you’ ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have, and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested, how to get tested, and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others.
If you’ re sick and you think you’ ve been exposed to the new coronavirus, the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’ s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’ re asymptomatic, for instance — you won’ t be able to get tested.
The new virus has brought back memories of the SARS outbreak, which was also caused by a coronavirus. SARS, which is believed to have jumped to humans from animals at markets, originated in China and spread to other countries, infecting more than 8,000 people and killing more than 800.
While the new coronavirus appears to be less severe than SARS, public health officials around the world are exercising caution.
On Friday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States announced that airports in New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles would begin screening passengers from Wuhan for the virus.
W. Ian Lipkin, a Columbia University professor who worked to fight the SARS outbreak, said it was too early to know how dangerous the new virus might prove to be.
“ Until it becomes capable of human-to-human transmission, there’ s not a major threat of a pandemic, ” said Dr. Lipkin, the director of the Center for Infection and Immunity at the university’ s Mailman School of Public Health.
“ We need to prepare for the possibility that this could be a larger outbreak, and it could become a pandemic, ” he said. “ But that doesn’ t mean that it will. ”

383,Malta minister quits over husband's links to reporter murder 'mastermind ',"Hi, what are you looking for?
By
Published
Maltese minister Justyne Caruana resigned Monday after her husband, a former investigator into the murder of a prominent journalist, was revealed to have holidayed with the alleged mastermind behind the killing.
Caruana -- who was appointed to the government's brand-new cabinet just last week -- said in her resignation letter that she was quitting despite being `` totally extraneous '' to the affair, the prime minister's office said in a statement.
Her exit came after the Times of Malta said Sunday her husband, Silvio Valletta, travelled to a football match in Britain with tycoon Yorgen Fenech, who has been charged with complicity in the murder of Daphne Caruana Galizia.
Caruana had sworn in on Wednesday as minister for the island of Gozo under Malta's new leader Robert Abela.
She had held the same post under his predecessor, Joseph Muscat, who resigned over allegations he hampered the murder probe.
Valletta was deputy police commissioner at the time of blogger Caruana Galizia's 2017 car bomb murder. She had exposed high level corruption in the island state.
He suspended himself from the case in June 2018 after a court upheld a claim by the slain reporter's family that there was a conflict of interest, because of the investigator's ties to a minister in a government Caruana Galizia had frequented targeted.
That ruling was appealed by the attorney general, but upheld by the country's highest court in October 2018.
Valletta travelled to watch a football match at Chelsea FC's Stamford Bridge Stadium in September 2018, after suspending himself from the case but before the constitutional court's decision.
A video showing him in Fenech's Rolls Royce was found on the businessman's phone.
Fenech was charged as an accomplice in the murder after being detained trying to leave the country on his yacht.
His arrest in November sparked the resignation of Muscat's chief of staff and the tourism minister, before claiming Muscat's scalp as well.
Three men are on trial for allegedly detonating the bomb that killed the 53-year-old mother of three.
Valletta on Sunday admitted the holiday with Fenech, but said it only came once he had stepped aside from the case.
He said he paid for the flights himself, and he did not know Fenech was a suspect in the murder at the time.
`` I never did anything wrong and would certainly never have gone abroad with anyone who I suspected or knew to be under investigation '', Valletta, who retired from the police force in September, told journalists.
Malta's home affairs minister said Valletta's trip with Fenech will be investigated.

Valletta was deputy police commissioner at the time of blogger Caruana Galizia’ s 2017 car bomb murder. She had exposed high level corruption in the island state.
He suspended himself from the case in June 2018 after a court upheld a claim by the slain reporter’ s family that there was a conflict of interest, because of the investigator’ s ties to a minister in a government Caruana Galizia had frequented targeted.
That ruling was appealed by the attorney general, but upheld by the country’ s highest court in October 2018.


Valletta travelled to watch a football match at Chelsea FC’ s Stamford Bridge Stadium in September 2018, after suspending himself from the case but before the constitutional court’ s decision.
A video showing him in Fenech’ s Rolls Royce was found on the businessman’ s phone.
Fenech was charged as an accomplice in the murder after being detained trying to leave the country on his yacht.
His arrest in November sparked the resignation of Muscat’ s chief of staff and the tourism minister, before claiming Muscat’ s scalp as well.
Three men are on trial for allegedly detonating the bomb that killed the 53-year-old mother of three.
Valletta on Sunday admitted the holiday with Fenech, but said it only came once he had stepped aside from the case.
He said he paid for the flights himself, and he did not know Fenech was a suspect in the murder at the time.
“ I never did anything wrong and would certainly never have gone abroad with anyone who I suspected or knew to be under investigation ”, Valletta, who retired from the police force in September, told journalists.
Malta’ s home affairs minister said Valletta’ s trip with Fenech will be investigated.

388,China Confirms New Coronavirus Spreads From Humans to Humans,"WUHAN, China — The mysterious coronavirus that has killed at least four people and sickened more than 200 in China is capable of spreading from person to person, a prominent Chinese scientist said on Monday, adding to fears of a broader epidemic.
The disclosure increased pressure on the Chinese government to contain a growing public health crisis, just as China enters its busiest travel season of the year. On Tuesday, the authorities confirmed a fourth death from the illness in the central Chinese city of Wuhan.
The authorities had previously said the deadly virus seemed capable of spreading only from animals to humans in most cases, tracing the outbreak to a market in Wuhan.
But in recent days at least two people have become infected with the pneumonialike virus even though they live hundreds of miles from Wuhan, experts said on Monday, suggesting that the illness is spreading from person to person.
“ Now we can say it is certain that it is a human-to-human transmission phenomenon, ” Dr. Zhong Nanshan, a scientist who is leading a government-appointed expert panel on the outbreak, said in an interview on state-run television on Monday.
The World Health Organization announced Monday that it was convening an emergency meeting on Wednesday “ to ascertain whether the outbreak constitutes a public health emergency of international concern, and what recommendations should be made to manage it. ”
Millions of Chinese are traveling this week for the Lunar New Year holiday, adding to fears that the virus could spread swiftly and on a broader scale. Experts said the severity of the outbreak would now depend on how many people, on average, a person with virus could infect.
“ There are now sufficient cases that it’ s not going to die out by chance, ” said Neil Ferguson, a public health expert at Imperial College London who has studied the new virus. “ The real question now is, how efficiently can this virus spread from person to person? ”
China’ s leader, Xi Jinping, said on Monday that the outbreak “ must be taken seriously ” and that every possible measure should be taken to contain it, according to the state broadcaster CCTV.
Also on Monday, the authorities reported that new cases had been detected for the first time in Beijing, Shanghai and the southern province of Guangdong, all hundreds of miles from Wuhan. Cases have also been reported in Japan, South Korea and Thailand. In many of these cases, people infected with the virus had traveled to Wuhan.
Here is what we know about the virus, where it has been found, how it is spreading and what precautions are being taken:
The government of Wuhan first confirmed on Dec. 31 that hospitals in the city were treating dozens of patients for pneumonia with an unknown cause.
Many of the cases were connected to the Huanan Seafood Market, which also sold live poultry and exotic animal meats. Considered a likely source of the virus, the market was closed and disinfected.
The health commission in Wuhan said on Sunday that the illness had also appeared in people who had not been exposed to the market, raising the possibility that the virus could be present elsewhere in the city.
Local officials have pledged to handle the outbreak with transparency. But the memory of how China initially covered up the extent of a deadly SARS outbreak that infected more than 8,000 people in 2002 and 2003 has not completely faded. Although flu experts have said the Chinese government is trying to be more transparent now, many in China remain skeptical.
Over the weekend, the number of reported cases more than tripled to about 200, mostly in Wuhan. One more person in the city died, bringing the total death toll to three, while nine others remained critically ill, the city’ s health commission said. Twenty-five people have recovered.
The authorities have started detecting the country’ s first cases outside of Wuhan. Five new cases were reported in Beijing, 14 in Guangdong Province, and two in Shanghai. The total number of cases climbed to at least 219.
The World Health Organization said the spike in reported cases was the result of increased searching and testing for respiratory illnesses.
Researchers in China identified the mysterious pneumonialike illness in early January as a new coronavirus.
Experts initially said that it did not appear to be readily spread by humans, but on Monday Dr. Zhong, the scientist appointed by the government to study the outbreak, said that in Guangdong, two individuals appeared to have been infected by relatives who had traveled to Wuhan.
Dr. Zhong said the virus could be present in particles of saliva. In one case, he said, a patient appears to have infected 14 medical workers.
Coronaviruses are named for the spikes that protrude from their membranes, like the sun’ s corona. Such viruses cause several illnesses of the respiratory tract, ranging from the common cold to severe diseases like SARS. Dr. Zhong was China’ s leading SARS expert during that outbreak.
According to the World Health Organization, common signs of infection include fever, cough, and respiratory difficulties like shortness of breath. Serious cases can lead to pneumonia, kidney failure and even death.
The authorities in Thailand detected the new coronavirus last week in two Chinese women who had flown from Wuhan to Bangkok on separate trips. The government said the women, aged 74 and 61, were in good condition.
In Japan, a Chinese man who returned from Wuhan on Jan. 6 was also confirmed to have the disease. He was discharged after five days in a hospital.
Updated June 12, 2020
Touching contaminated objects and then infecting ourselves with the germs is not typically how the virus spreads. But it can happen. A number of studies of flu, rhinovirus, coronavirus and other microbes have shown that respiratory illnesses, including the new coronavirus, can spread by touching contaminated surfaces, particularly in places like day care centers, offices and hospitals. But a long chain of events has to happen for the disease to spread that way. The best way to protect yourself from coronavirus — whether it’ s surface transmission or close human contact — is still social distancing, washing your hands, not touching your face and wearing masks.
So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited paper published in April suggests that people are most infectious about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms. Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have symptoms was “ very rare, ” but she later walked back that statement.
A study by European scientists is the first to document a strong statistical link between genetic variations and Covid-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus. Having Type A blood was linked to a 50 percent increase in the likelihood that a patient would need to get oxygen or to go on a ventilator, according to the new study.
The unemployment rate fell to 13.3 percent in May, the Labor Department said on June 5, an unexpected improvement in the nation’ s job market as hiring rebounded faster than economists expected. Economists had forecast the unemployment rate to increase to as much as 20 percent, after it hit 14.7 percent in April, which was the highest since the government began keeping official statistics after World War II. But the unemployment rate dipped instead, with employers adding 2.5 million jobs, after more than 20 million jobs were lost in April.
Mass protests against police brutality that have brought thousands of people onto the streets in cities across America are raising the specter of new coronavirus outbreaks, prompting political leaders, physicians and public health experts to warn that the crowds could cause a surge in cases. While many political leaders affirmed the right of protesters to express themselves, they urged the demonstrators to wear face masks and maintain social distancing, both to protect themselves and to prevent further community spread of the virus. Some infectious disease experts were reassured by the fact that the protests were held outdoors, saying the open air settings could mitigate the risk of transmission.
Exercise researchers and physicians have some blunt advice for those of us aiming to return to regular exercise now: Start slowly and then rev up your workouts, also slowly. American adults tended to be about 12 percent less active after the stay-at-home mandates began in March than they were in January. But there are steps you can take to ease your way back into regular exercise safely. First, “ start at no more than 50 percent of the exercise you were doing before Covid, ” says Dr. Monica Rho, the chief of musculoskeletal medicine at the Shirley Ryan AbilityLab in Chicago. Thread in some preparatory squats, too, she advises. “ When you haven’ t been exercising, you lose muscle mass. ” Expect some muscle twinges after these preliminary, post-lockdown sessions, especially a day or two later. But sudden or increasing pain during exercise is a clarion call to stop and return home.
States are reopening bit by bit. This means that more public spaces are available for use and more and more businesses are being allowed to open again. The federal government is largely leaving the decision up to states, and some state leaders are leaving the decision up to local authorities. Even if you aren’ t being told to stay at home, it’ s still a good idea to limit trips outside and your interaction with other people.
Common symptoms include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath. Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less common. The C.D.C. has also added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.
If air travel is unavoidable, there are some steps you can take to protect yourself. Most important: Wash your hands often, and stop touching your face. If possible, choose a window seat. A study from Emory University found that during flu season, the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window, as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people. Disinfect hard surfaces. When you get to your seat and your hands are clean, use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest, the seatbelt buckle, the remote, screen, seat back pocket and the tray table. If the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather, you can wipe that down, too. ( Using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them.)
Taking one’ s temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds, as “ normal ” temperature numbers can vary, but generally, keep an eye out for a temperature of 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit or higher. If you don’ t have a thermometer ( they can be pricey these days), there are other ways to figure out if you have a fever, or are at risk of Covid-19 complications.
The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now, the C.D.C., like the W.H.O., has advised that ordinary people don’ t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’ t replace hand washing and social distancing.
If you’ ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have, and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested, how to get tested, and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others.
If you’ re sick and you think you’ ve been exposed to the new coronavirus, the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’ s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’ re asymptomatic, for instance — you won’ t be able to get tested.
South Korea confirmed its first case of the coronavirus on Monday in a 35-year-old Chinese woman from Wuhan who arrived on Sunday at Incheon International Airport, which serves Seoul.
The woman was found with a fever, muscle pain and other symptoms while going through customs and was immediately quarantined for tests, said Jung Eun-kyeong, director of the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The woman was traveling with five other people intending to spend the Lunar New Year holidays in South Korea and Japan, Ms. Jung said. South Korean officials were running tests on anyone believed to have come in contact with the woman in the plane, she said.
In Hong Kong, the government initiated a disease response plan after the first cases were reported in Wuhan. Dozens of people were hospitalized after returning to Hong Kong from mainland China, but none were found to have been infected with the new virus.
Five people who traveled from Wuhan to Zhejiang, a coastal Chinese province south of Shanghai, are being treated for fever but have not been diagnosed with the new coronavirus, the health authorities there said.
State media also reported six suspected cases on Monday, including two in Sichuan Province, one in Shanghai, one in Yunnan Province, one in Shandong Province and one in the region of Guangxi.
In the southern city of Shenzhen, the authorities have started imposing temperature screening procedures at the airport and at train and bus stations. The city said it would also crack down on the illegal trading of wild animals.
The W.H.O. says animals appear to be the most likely primary source of the outbreak, though it is still not known which animals are responsible.
Past outbreaks of similar illnesses, like SARS, were believed to have emerged from markets where people and live animals were in regular contact.
To prevent the spread of respiratory infections, the W.H.O. recommends that people wash their hands regularly, cover their mouths and noses when coughing and sneezing, and avoid direct contact with farm or wild animals.
The health authorities in Hong Kong have also advised residents traveling outside the city not to touch live animals, not to eat wild animals, and to avoid markets selling fresh meat and live poultry.

411,"As virus spreads to more Chinese cities, WHO calls emergency meeting","An outbreak of a new coronavirus has spread to more Chinese cities, including the capital Beijing and Shanghai, authorities said on Monday, and a fourth case has been reported beyond China’ s borders.
China’ s National Health Commission confirmed that the virus, which causes a type of pneumonia, can pass from person-to-person, the official Xinhua News Agency said.
President Xi Jinping said curbing the outbreak and saving lives was a top priority as the number of patients more than tripled and a third person died.
Adding to the difficulties of containing it, hundreds of millions of Chinese will be travelling domestically and abroad during the Lunar New Year holiday that starts this week.
Authorities around the globe, including in the United States and many Asian countries, have stepped up screening of travellers from Wuhan, the central city where the virus was first discovered.
“ Wuhan is a major hub and with travel being a huge part of the fast approaching Chinese New Year, the concern level must remain high. There is more to come from this outbreak, ” said Jeremy Farrar, a specialist in infectious disease epidemics and director of the Wellcome Trust global health charity.
Authorities confirmed a total of 217 new cases of the virus in China as of 6 p.m. local time ( 1000 GMT) on Monday, state television reported, 198 of which were in Wuhan.
Five new cases were confirmed in Beijing and 14 more in Guangdong province, the report said. Another statement confirmed a new case in Shanghai, bringing the number of known cases worldwide to 222.
“ People’ s lives and health should be given top priority and the spread of the outbreak should be resolutely curbed, ” President Xi was quoted as saying by state television.
The virus belongs to the same family of coronaviruses as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome ( SARS), which killed nearly 800 people globally during a 2002/03 outbreak that also started in China.
Its symptoms include fever and difficulty in breathing, which are similar to many other respiratory diseases and pose complications for screening efforts.
Zhong Nanshan, a respiratory expert and head of the health commission team investigating the outbreak, confirmed that two cases of infection in Guangdong province were due to human-to-human transmission, Xinhua said. Some medical staff have been infected, it added, but gave no number.
South Korea on Monday confirmed its first case, a 35-year-old Chinese national who had travelled from Wuhan, the fourth patient reported outside China.
Last week, two cases were reported in Thailand and one in Japan. All three involved people from Wuhan or who recently visited the city.
A report by London Imperial College’ s MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis estimated that by Jan. 12 there were 1,723 cases in Wuhan City with onset of related symptoms. Chinese health authorities have not commented directly on the report.
“ This outbreak is extremely concerning. Uncertainty and gaps remain, but it is now clear that there is person to person transmission, ” Farrar said.
The World Health Organisation ( WHO) said on Monday “ an animal source ” appeared most likely to be the primary source of the outbreak and that some “ limited human-to-human transmission ” occurred between close contacts.
The Geneva-based U.N. agency later convened an emergency committee for Wednesday to assess whether the outbreak constitutes an international health emergency and what measures should be taken to manage it.
So far, the WHO has not recommended trade or travel restrictions, but a panel of independent experts could do so or make other recommendations to limit spread.
China’ s state council reiterated the government will step up prevention efforts and find the source of infection and transmission channels as soon as possible, state television said on Monday.
Shares in pharmaceutical firms and mask makers in China surged Monday because of the outbreak.
“ Who knows how many people who have been to Wuhan may be unaware that they have already been infected?, ” said one commentator on Chinese social media platform Weibo
The state-run Global Times newspaper said in an editorial the government needs to disclose all information and not repeat the mistakes made with SARS. Chinese officials covered up the SARS outbreak for weeks before a growing death toll and rumours forced it to reveal the epidemic.
“ Concealment would be a serious blow to the government’ s credibility and might trigger greater social panic, ” the editorial said.",business

The Dow snapped a five-day winning streak while the S & P 500 and Nasdaq posted their first loss in four sessions.
Shares of casino and hotel companies Wynn Resorts and Las Vegas Sands fell more than 6% and 5%, respectively, amid fears that the coronavirus outbreak in China would dent international travel.
Airline stocks hit their lows of the day following the news. United Airlines and Delta Air Lines both declined more than 2.5%. Shares of Southwest and American Airlines were down 2.7% and 4.2%, respectively.
Boeing shares added to the downturn, falling more than 3% on news the company doesn't expect regulators to sign off on the beleaguered jet, the 737 Max, until June or July. The shares were briefly halted.
Sentiment across global markets had taken a hit overnight amid concerns about the virus.
The outbreak of the new coronavirus in China has killed four people with confirmed cases exceeding 200 ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday, during which hundreds of millions of people are expected to travel. Late on Monday, Chinese authorities confirmed that the virus is contagious.
The new crisis reminded traders of the economic fallout from the deadly Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome ( SARS) crisis in 2003.
Asian equity markets tumbled overnight. The Shanghai Composite dropped 1.4% while the Hang Seng index slid 2.8%. In Japan, the Nikkei 225 index fell 0.9%. Korea's Kospi index also pulled back 1%.
Tuesday's declines paused the market's record-setting run. The Dow was headed for its first decline in six sessions while the S & P 500 was set to snap a three-day winning streak. U.S. markets were closed Monday due to the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday.
Still, the market has already carried momentum in 2020 from a strong performance in 2019. The S & P 500 surged more than 28% last year, its biggest annual gain since 2013. This year, it is up around 3%.

Sentiment on Tuesday also soured slightly after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told The Wall Street Journal that a phase two trade deal between China and the U.S. may not remove all existing tariffs. `` We may do 2A and some of the tariffs come off. We can do this sequentially along the way, '' he said.
President Donald Trump also told the Journal he is `` absolutely serious '' about imposing tariffs on European cars if a trade deal with the region can not be struck.
Meanwhile, the International Monetary Fund ( IMF) on Monday downgraded its global economic growth forecast from 3.4% to 3.3% for 2020. The U.S. economy is projected to grow by 2.0% this year, a downward revision of 0.1 percentage points compared with the IMF's October 2019 forecast.
But John Augustine, chief investment officer at Huntington Private Bank, thinks this market can yield further returns for investors.
`` We think stocks could run for a while, absent some event, '' Augustine said. `` We're starting to see signs of confirmation elsewhere. It's not just the Nasdaq and the big tech names. ''

486,Precision Regulation for Artificial Intelligence,"Among companies building and deploying artificial intelligence, and the consumers making use of this technology, trust is of paramount importance. Companies want the comfort of knowing how their AI systems are making determinations, and that they are in compliance with any relevant regulations, and consumers want to know when the technology is being used and how ( or whether) it will impact their lives.
62% of Americans and 70% Europeans prefer a precision regulation approach for technology, with less than 10% in either region supporting broad regulation of tech. 85% of Europeans and 81% of Americans support consumer data protection in some form, and 70% of Europeans and 60% of Americans support AI regulation. Source: Morning Consult study conducted on behalf of the IBM Policy Lab, January 2020.
As outlined in our Principles for Trust and Transparency, IBM has long argued that AI systems need to be transparent and explainable. That’ s one reason why we supported the EU and the OECD AI Principles, and in particular the focus on transparency and trustworthiness in both.
Principles are admirable and can help communicate a company’ s commitments to citizens and consumers. But it’ s past time to move from principles to policy. Requiring disclosure — as appropriate based on use-case and end-user — should be the default expectation for many companies creating, distributing, or commercializing AI systems. In an earlier Policy Lab essay, we articulated a disclosure requirement for law enforcement use-cases of facial recognition technology. Something similar should be required of AI more generally in order to provide the public with appropriate assurances that they are being treated fairly and equitably by AI-based determinations in sensitive use-cases.
That is why today we are calling for precision regulation of AI. We support targeted policies that would increase the responsibilities for companies to develop and operate trustworthy AI. Given the ubiquity of AI — it touches all of us in our daily lives and work — there will be no one-size-fits-all rules that can properly accommodate the many unique characteristics of every industry making use of this technology and its impact on individuals. But we can define an appropriate risk-based AI governance policy framework based on three pillars:
Wisely, the OECD AI Principles suggest a solid accountability bedrock for this framework, arguing that “ [ g ] overnments should promote a policy environment that supports an agile transition from the research and development stage to the deployment and operation stage for trustworthy AI systems. ” This implicit recognition of the fundamental difference in accountability between stages of AI development can help appropriately assign responsibility for providing transparency and ensuring fairness and security, based on who has better control over the protection of privacy, civil liberties, and harm- prevention activities in a given context.
In the lifecycle of AI capabilities in the marketplace, organizations may contribute research, the creation of tooling, and APIs; in later stages of operation, organizations will train, manage, and control, operate, or own the AI models that are put to real-world commercial use. These different functions may allow for a distinction between “ providers ” and “ owners, ” with expectations of responsibilities based on how an organization’ s role falls into one or both categories.
Differentiating accountability can help to better mitigate potential harm by directing resources and oversight to specific applications of AI based on the severity and likelihood of potential harms arising from the end-use and user of such systems. Risk-based regulatory approaches like this — which also allow for more manageable and incremental changes to existing rules — are ideal means to protect consumers, build public trust in AI, and provide innovators with needed flexibility and adaptability.
Building from these pillars, we propose a precision regulation framework that incorporates 5 policy imperatives for companies, based on whether they are a provider or owner ( or both) of an AI system. These policies would vary in robustness according to the level of risk presented by a particular AI system, which would be determined by conducting an initial risk assessment based on potential for harm associated with the intended use, the level of automation ( and human involvement), and whether an end-user is substantially reliant on the AI system based on end-user and use-case.
To ensure compliance with these expectations, providers and owners should designate a person responsible for trustworthy AI, such as a lead AI ethics official. This person would be accountable for internal guidance and compliance mechanisms, such as an AI Ethics Board, that oversee risk assessments and harm mitigation strategies. As the complexity and potential impact of AI systems increases, so too must the accountability embraced by different organizations providing various functions in the AI life cycle. A market environment that prioritizes the adoption of lead AI ethics officials, or other designated individuals, to oversee and manage this increasing complexity could help to mitigate risks and improve public acceptance and trust of these systems, while also driving firms’ commitment to the responsible development, deployment, and overall stewardship of this important technology.
All entities providing or owning an AI system should conduct an initial high-level assessment of the technology’ s potential for harm. As noted previously, such assessments should be based on the intended use-case application ( s), end-user ( s), how reliant the end-user would be on the technology, and the level of automation. Once initial risk is determined, a more in-depth and detailed assessment should be undertaken for higher-risk applications. In certain low-risk situations, a more cursory appraisal would likely suffice. For those high-risk use-cases, the assessment processes should be documented in detail, be auditable, and retained for a minimum period of time.
Transparency breeds trust; and the best way to promote transparency is through disclosure. Unlike other transparency proposals, this approach does not entail companies revealing source code or other forms of trade secrets or IP. Instead it focuses on making the purpose of an AI system clear to consumers and businesses. Such disclosures, like other policy imperatives here, should be reasonably linked to the potential risk and harm to individuals. As such, low-risk and benign applications of AI may not require the type of disclosure that higher-risk use-cases might require.
Any AI system on the market that is making determinations or recommendations with potentially significant implications for individuals should be able to explain and contextualize how and why it arrived at a particular conclusion. To achieve that, it is necessary for organizations to maintain audit trails surrounding their input and training data. Owners and operators of these systems should also make available — as appropriate and in a context that the relevant end-user can understand — documentation that detail essential information for consumers to be aware of, such as confidence measures, levels of procedural regularity, and error analysis.
All organizations in the AI developmental lifecycle have some level of shared responsibility in ensuring the AI systems they design and deploy are fair and secure. This requires testing for fairness, bias, robustness and security, and taking remedial actions as needed, both before sale or deployment and after it is operationalized. Owners should also be responsible for ensuring use of their AI systems is aligned with anti-discrimination laws, as well as statutes addressing safety, privacy, financial disclosure, consumer protection, employment, and other sensitive contexts. For many use-cases, owners should continually monitor, or retest, the AI models after the product is released to identify and mitigate against any machine-learning resulting in unintended outcomes.Policies should create an environment that incentivizes both providers and owners to do such testing well.This can be done without creating new and potentially cumbersome AI-specific regulatory requirements, but rather by adhering to a set of agreed-upon definitions, best practices, and global standards.
74% of American and 85% of EU respondents are in agreement that artificial intelligence systems should be transparent and explainable, and strong pluralities in both countries believe that disclosure should be required for companies creating or distributing AI systems. Nearly 3 in 4 Europeans and two- thirds of Americans support regulations such as conducting risk assessments, doing pre-deployment testing for bias and fairness, and reporting to consumers and businesses that an AI system is being used in decision making. Source: Morning Consult study conducted on behalf of the IBM Policy Lab, January 2020.
Finally, any action or practice prohibited by anti- discrimination laws should continue to be prohibited when it involves an automated decision-making system. Whether a decision is fully rendered by a human or a determination is assisted by an automated AI system, impermissibly biased or discriminatory outcomes should never be considered acceptable. But whereas correcting the bias of humans is a daunting and difficult task, in AI systems it may be a matter of addressing historical bias in some training data by testing for, and correcting, statistical failures in the model. While this will take time, AI offers us the promise of a world where bias and discrimination may one day fade away. With precision regulations helping to promote trustworthy AI, that future could be sooner than we think.

488,China is trying to stop the spread of new coronavirus at worst possible time of year,"No health authority has ever tackled the challenge currently faced by China, however, as the country grapples with a new coronavirus just as hundreds of millions prepare to travel during the Lunar New Year period -- the largest annual human migration on Earth.
During the Lunar holiday, people from across the country will cram themselves into homebound trains, buses and planes for family reunions. Others will take advantage of the time off to holiday overseas. Last year, close to 7 million Chinese tourists traveled abroad for Lunar New Year, according to state media.
The holiday -- the most important in the Chinese calendar -- comes at the worst possible time for health authorities racing to contain the outbreak which has put the rest of Asia on alert.

The virus, which was first identified in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, is known to have infected more than 300 people and spread to at least three other countries already. On Monday, China's National Health Commission confirmed that the Wuhan coronavirus can be passed from human-to-human and that medical staff had also been infected.
The spread of the mysterious respiratory virus to Thailand, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and the United States, is fueling fears of a broader epidemic, as China enters its busiest travel period of the year.
`` One of the consequences of a more connected world is that outbreaks have the potential to spread internationally much more rapidly than was the case 50 years ago, '' said Mike Turner, director of science at the Wellcome Trust, a UK-based global health charity.
More cases have also been reported within China, evidence that the outbreak has spread well beyond Wuhan, creating a risk of unpredictable further infection.

As of Tuesday morning, five cases have been confirmed in Beijing, two in Shanghai, and 14 in the southern province of Guangdong -- all hundreds of miles from Wuhan. Additional suspected cases have been reported across the country, from eastern Shandong province to Sichuan province in the southwest.
Chinese scientists on January 8 identified the pathogen as a new strain of coronavirus, the same family as severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS). In 2002 and 2003, SARS infected more than 8,000 people and killed 774 in a pandemic that ripped through Asia, spreading as far as Canada.
During a news conference Monday, Zhong Nanshan, a Chinese government-appointed expert who helped discover the SARS coronavirus, said the infectiousness of the new Wuhan coronavirus was not as strong as SARS, but that the disease was `` climbing '' and suggested that the `` death rate at the moment is not so representative. '' Since December, four people infected with the Wuhan coronavirus have died.

Uncertainties about the Wuhan coronavirus -- including its unidentified source -- have prompted fears there may be more people infected than currently reported.
Jeremy Farrar, an infectious disease expert who heads the Wellcome Trust, said the outbreak is `` extremely concerning. ''
`` It is possible that often mild symptoms, and probability of people being affected and infectious without experiencing symptoms, from this coronavirus may be masking the true numbers of people who have been infected, and the extent of person to person transmission, '' said Farrar.
Initial symptoms of the Wuhan coronavirus include fever and coughing -- which are also common flu symptoms, a viral infection prevalent in the winter months. Some patients infected with the coronavirus also have difficulty breathing and invasive lesions on the lungs, according to the World Health Organization ( WHO).
The WHO will convene an emergency meeting on Wednesday to discuss the outbreak in China.
Transportation hub
The recent spike in confirmed Wuhan coronavirus cases appears to point to a wider area of contamination. According to a recent study by Imperial College London, the number of infections in Wuhan itself are likely a gross underestimation, raising the risk that carriers of the virus may have already traveled elsewhere within China before screening measures were put in place.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said Monday that since the outbreak, China has been taking active measures to handle the epidemic and formulate prevention and control plans.
China's National Health Commission said Sunday that the situation of the outbreak is `` still preventable and controllable. ''
The more than 200 cases officially confirmed in China is a far cry from the 1,700 the British researchers estimate to have been infected by January 12. The UK team based their calculations on the number of cases reported already in Thailand and Japan, and the estimated number of people departing Wuhan's international airport.

More than 60 routes connect Wuhan with other countries, including direct flights to New York, San Francisco, Sydney, Paris and London, as well as over a hundred internal flights to other major Chinese cities. The central city of 11 million people is also a hub for the country's high-speed rail network.
Governments around the world have begun responding to the perceived threat. On Tuesday, Australia said it is adding border measures for flights from Wuhan to Sydney. The US also announced screening measures for passengers arriving from Wuhan at airports in New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles last week, following similar measures taken by governments in Asia.
In Wuhan itself, infrared thermometers have been installed at the airport, train stations, coach terminals and passenger piers to measure the temperatures of passengers departing the city since January 14, according to state media.
Those measures were only put in place five weeks after the initial outbreak, meaning countless passengers have left the city without undergoing any screening.
Nor is it clear that the screening or heightened attention in Wuhan is working: the woman diagnosed with the coronavirus in South Korea had visited a doctor in the city after developing a fever and muscle pains. She was prescribed cold medicine and sent on her way.

Cover-up concerns
The legacy of SARS hangs long over the current outbreak. During that pandemic, the Chinese government was initially slow to release information, censoring news and downplaying the severity of the outbreak. The lack of transparency sparked backlash at home and drew heavy criticism from foreign governments and the WHO.
In April 2003, a prominent doctor in Beijing went on the record to accuse the government of a coverup. Later in the month, China sacked its health minister and the mayor of Beijing over their mishandling of the outbreak.
This time around, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission declared the outbreak on December 31, three weeks after the first patient developed symptoms. Chinese scientists identified the pathogen a week later and shared the genome sequence of the virus with the WHO -- a speedy response that earned praise from the WHO and scientists around the world.
The Wuhan health commission has also been posting frequent -- and now daily -- updates on the latest infection numbers on its website, but that has failed to allay fears over the disease spreading.
The Wuhan health commission announced Monday that 136 new cases had been diagnosed on Saturday and Sunday, including one death. The number was a significant jump from the 62 reported during the weekend, but far short of the estimate by the Imperial College London researchers.
The WHO said the spike in reported cases was the result of `` increased searching and testing '' of the virus among people with respiratory illness.

Before this weekend, Wuhan authorities had maintained for two weeks that no new cases had been detected since January 3. Even as cases were confirmed overseas, there was a complete lack of information on potential infections elsewhere in China, leading to a growing sense of unease and accusations of a coverup by local or national authorities.
On Weibo, a Twitter-like social media service, many people questioned the silence from the provincial authorities in particular, pointing out the unlikeliness that only those people who left the country were found to be carrying the virus.
`` Does it mean that Wuhan residents only travel abroad but not to other ( Chinese) cities? '' one user asked in a popular post.
Increased concerns around person-to-person transmission, combined with the mass travel expected in the coming weeks, will have health authorities -- and the public -- on edge to see just how far the new virus spreads.
On Monday, Chinese President Xi Jinping instructed authorities to take `` resolute efforts '' to contain the spread of the Wuhan coronavirus, the first time the country's leader has publicly spoken on the outbreak.
According to a statement carried on state news agency Xinhua, Xi `` stressed putting people's safety and health as the top priority '' and urged relevant departments to release information promptly and deepen international cooperation.",business

Longtime options trader and `` Halftime Report '' trader Jon Najarian said on Wednesday he's joined Greenlight Capital founder David Einhorn in a bet against Netflix. In explaining his `` big '' short, Najarian said the video streamer's stock is so expensive that it can't afford to disappoint Wall Street's subscriber expectations like it did on Tuesday. Netflix fell short of subscriber addition estimates in the U.S. and Canada in the fourth quarter, a fact the company said could be due to recent price changes and launches of rival streaming platforms. Najarian's announcement comes a day after CNBC reported that Einhorn increased his own short bet against Netflix in late 2019. The Greenlight founder told investors that `` there are now a half-dozen subscription services and in the coming year there will be additional credible entrants with deep content libraries.

Home sales in December totaled 5.54 million, vs. 5.43 million expected. It's the highest level since February 2018. The clincher is the supply of homes for resale at 3 months, a record low, and that in itself is enough to put a lift in the homebuilders.Recent housing data has been very strong. —Domm

U.S. home sales easily beat expectations, jumping to a nearly 2-year high. U.S. home sales increased 3.6% in December to a seasonally adjusted 5.54 million. Economists polled by Reuters expected a gain of 1.3% to 5.43 million units sold. The report from the National Association of Realtors is the latest sign the U.S. housing market is getting a boost from the three rate cuts implemented by the Federal Reserve last year. Data released last week showed housing stars surged last month to a 13-year high. Homebuilders Toll Brothers and Lennar were higher. —Imbert

The 10-year Treasury yield has been resting at 1.76%, after dropping to that level as the world worried about the new Chinese coronavirus Tuesday. Risk markets are rallying, and yields are higher Wednesday, but the 10-year still hovers near Tuesday's lows, a key level on the charts. `` That 1.76 level has provided support at a few different moments in January. It also corresponds to the bottom of an opening gap, back to some of the volatility around the Iranian tensions, '' said Jon Hill of BMO. `` But the intraday low of Jan. 8 was 1.70. That to me is the defacto range bound. '' He said it's now testing resistance for further rallies in duration. Yields move lower when bond prices rise.

United Airlines jumped nearly 1%, American Airlines rose more than 1% and Delta Air and Southwest all gained slightly in premarket trading. -Fitzgerald
Wall Street may be using the earnings season to take profits off the table after the market's stunning run to record highs this past one year. Data compiled by Bespoke Investment Group shows stocks have opened higher by an average of 0.62% after a company reports quarterly earnings. However, those stocks decline by an average of 0.56% into market close. `` We're seeing investors use earnings as a reason to lighten up a bit, '' Bespoke said in a tweet.—Imbert
Netflix was the first of the so-called FANG stocks to report fourth-quarter results. The streaming giant beat on the top and bottom line, but gave disappointing guidance and posted a miss on domestic subscriber growth. Wall Street analysts largely looked past the weakness and believe Netflix is on the right track to profitability. Goldman Sachs said the company's content investments, distribution partnerships and global positioning should drive subscriber growth `` significantly above consensus expectations. '' Bank of America expects Netflix to be `` increasingly dominant overseas '' in the next year. Credit Suisse said the set-up is `` quite favorable for Netflix heading into 2020, '' and the subscriber guidance looks `` conservative. '' Shares of Netflix rose more than 1% in premarket trading on Wednesday, after losing as much as 2% Tuesday after the bell following the earnings report.Click here to read more about what every major analyst had to say about Netflix's latest earnings. -Li

528,Inside ground zero of China's coronavirus outbreak: you can't even tell Lunar New Year is in town,"A deadly outbreak of the new coronavirus emerged in this city of 11 million people last month. Within weeks, the virus has killed nine people, sickened hundreds and spread as far as the United States.
Wuhan has been on high alert since the number of confirmed infections surged into the hundreds earlier this week.
New year celebrations that had been expected to attract hundreds of thousands of people have been canceled. In some parts of the city, including a major shopping area, streets remain largely empty, with most people walking outside donning face masks.

In the city's center, the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market sits empty, its rows of stalls shuttered. Police and security officers in face masks stand guard outside, prohibiting anyone from filming or entering a cordoned off area.
The market has always been a popular spot at this time of the year, packed with shoppers stocking up on fish and seafood for Lunar New Year feasts with family and friends.
But this year, Chinese authorities and scientists say wild animals sold at this market are the likely source of the new strain of coronavirus, which is in the same family of viruses as the deadly severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS).
The virus -- which can infect humans and animals -- has since spread to Thailand, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and the United States. Officials in Washington state confirmed the first case on US soil Tuesday.
The market has been closed since January 1 for disinfection, but health authorities have not found out which animals are the source.

'How can I not be worried? '
Not far from the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, Xiao Chuan'an, from a neighboring city, is selling sugar cane she imported from southern Guangdong province.
`` I do feel a bit scared, '' she told CNN. `` How can I not be worried? The situation sounds really serious. The news on the phone sounds really scary. ''
The country's National Health Commission confirmed this week the virus can be transmitted between people, after Wuhan health authorities maintained for two weeks that there was `` no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission. ''


In Hubei province, where Wuhan is located, 270 people have been infected as of Wednesday, and nine of them have died, according to the commission. At least 453 cases had been confirmed throughout China, leading to fears of a possible epidemic.
Xiao said her family had repeatedly urged her to go home, fearing that she will catch the virus in Wuhan. But she wants to stay to sell the sugar cane. However, business has been bad -- people are too scared to come to the market to shop, she said.
`` You can see now -- does it look like the atmosphere of Chinese New Year? '' she said. `` I don't know when the pneumonia epidemic will stop... I might have to eat instant noodles during Chinese New Year. ''

Emergency measures
The city government announced a series of new measures Tuesday to contain the outbreak -- efforts some critics say came too late -- the virus has already spread to a dozen provinces across the country.
Tour agencies in Wuhan have been banned from taking groups out of the city. Infrared thermometers have been installed at the airport, train stations, coach terminals and passenger piers to measure the temperatures of passengers departing the city since January 14, according to state media.

The city has over 60 routes connecting Wuhan with international cities, including direct flights to New York, San Francisco, Sydney, Paris and London, as well as over a hundred internal flights to other major Chinese cities. It is also a hub for the country's high-speed rail network.
At the high-speed rail station, the only faces that stand out are the uncovered ones, with the vast majority of passengers donning masks. As they prepare to exit the station, a railway staff member -- also wearing a mask and gloves -- puts a thermometer at the head of each passenger, checking for a fever.

On a high speed train from Beijing to Wuhan, railway attendants and security guards left their faces uncovered. A train attendant told CNN they were asked by management not to wear masks, as it may trigger a panic among passengers.
But she added that the train company is preparing to purchase masks and they will begin wearing them should the situation worsen.
Some hotels in the city said they will also screen guests, checking their temperature and asking them to sanitize their hands upon entry.

On Wednesday, the general manager of the Westin hotel in Wuhan told CNN he had asked staff to start wearing face masks `` for both their safety and for the safety of our guests. ''
Others, however, are less worried about the outbreak. Yan Weixi, a jackfruit seller who did not wear a mask, said she did not find the situation `` so scary. ''
`` I have been checking online instructions... like drinking more water or washing your hands more frequently. I think that should be fine, '' said Yan, from northeastern Heilongjiang province, who is spending her first Lunar New Year in Wuhan.
`` The most important thing is to keep a positive attitude, because if you're more scared, it's more likely you would catch the virus, '' she said. `` That's my opinion. ''",business

What is the virus?


Coronavirus is a large family of viruses, which include severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome ( MERS).
Common symptoms include a runny nose, cough, sore throat, and possibly a headache. Those who have a weakened immune system, particularly the young and the elderly, are at risk of the virus turning into a more serious respiratory tract illness.

Authorities said the Wuhan coronavirus was passed from animals to humans; can be spread from person to person; and appears to cause pneumonia in people who have weakened immune systems.
It is thought to be milder that SARS and MERS and take longer to develop symptoms. Patients to date have typically experienced a mild cough for a week followed by shortness of breath, causing them to visit a hospital.
Experts are now trying to understand how it is being transmitted, who is at most risk and whether transmission is occurring mostly in hospitals or in the community.
In one instance, 14 doctors and nurses operating on a patient -- who was not known to be carrying the virus -- were all infected with it, suggesting it can be spread relatively easily.

Where is this happening?
Where it started: Ground zero



The outbreak emerged last month in the largest city in central China, Wuhan, a city of 11 million people in Hubei province.
Officials linked it to Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, saying wild animals sold there are the likely source of the virus. The market has been closed since January 1 for disinfection and officials are scrambling to discover its animal source.
Snakes -- the Chinese krait and the Chinese cobra -- may be responsible for transmitting coronavirus to humans.

Scientists in China say that the virus might have jumped from bats to snakes, which were sold in the local seafood market in Wuhan, and then to humans.
However, how the virus could adapt to both the cold-blooded and warm-blooded hosts remains a mystery, and further tests are necessary to determine the source animal.
At least 30 people died in the province, many of them elderly and suffering from pre-existing conditions.
As deaths mount in the city, officials imposed a number of new measures including the postponement of New Year celebrations in Wuhan, a ban on tour agencies from bringing groups of people out of the city and thermal monitors and screening in public spaces.

Regional spread

From the first reported case in December, in Hubei province, the virus has spread to almost all of China's administrative regions this week.
The country has adopted prevention and control measures that are typically used for major outbreaks such as plague and cholera. This means health officials will get sweeping powers to lock down affected areas and quarantine patients.
Wuhan `` temporarily '' closed its airport and railway stations on Thursday for departing passengers, and all public transport services are suspended until further notice.
The city's coronavirus task force also announced the closure of highways out of the city.
Meanwhile, the city made it mandatory for everyone to wear face masks in public places after confirmed coronavirus cases passed the 500 mark.

Unprecedented lockdown
Authorities in China have imposed indefinite travel restrictions in 15 cities in Hubei province, the most affected area in the country, impacting an estimated 32 million people.
Wuhan, a city of 11 million, is under effective lockdown, with all public transport in and out of the city closed.
Other cities across the province are under less severe travel restrictions.

A global threat: Confirmed cases around the world


The virus has spread well beyond mainland China, so far to 13 places including Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand, Japan, Vietnam, Australia and the United States.
Airports around the world have increased health screenings and implemented new quarantine procedures as officials race to slow the spread of the virus.
Various countries, including the US and the UK, have also issued travel advisories for Wuhan.

International flights from Wuhan


Wuhan is a major transportation hub.
Not only is the city a center for China's high-speed rail network, it has flights going to more than 60 international destinations from Tianhe International Airport.
On Thursday, as confirmed cases ramped up across the country, government officials announced the temporary closure of Wuhan's airport and railway stations.
All train tickets in and out of Wuhan have also been suspended, while multiple international airlines have canceled flights to the city.
China has encouraged passengers traveling to and from Wuhan to change their travel plans during the busy Lunar New Year holiday period, by exempting them from service charges for refunds for all modes of transport.
How does this compare to the SARS virus?

Scientists say the infectiousness of the virus is not as strong as SARS, but have added that the number of people infected is climbing.
A study by researchers in the UK estimated that the number of infections in Wuhan is still grossly underestimated, with the real number closer to 4,000 as of January 18, based on the spread of the virus to other cities and countries in a relatively short period of time.
SARS infected more than 8,000 people and killed 774 in a pandemic that ripped through Asia in 2002 and 2003.
On Thursday, David Heymann, the chairman of a World Health Organization committee gathering data on the outbreak, said the virus spreads more easily from person to person than previously thought.
But there is still much that is not known about the virus and, as the above graphic shows, its death rate is far smaller than that seen during the SARS outbreak.",business
554,Coronavirus not yet declared a public health emergency,"Officials at the World Health Organization said the emergency committee is split on whether to declare the new coronavirus a public health emergency of international concern. The committee, which met Wednesday, will meet again on Thursday `` given the rapidly evolving situation. '' The new virus was first identified in December in Wuhan City, China.
Media outlets
, citing Chinese health authorities, have reported that 17 people have died, and 500 people have been infected. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
said Tuesday
that a U.S. resident returning from Wuhan City who has been diagnosed with the virus is being treated in Washington state. Health officials now believe that the virus is spread human to human.",business
562,What is the threat to Australia from the new coronavirus?,"Nine people are confirmed to have died and at least 440 have been infected in the outbreak of a new Sars-like virus that was first reported in the central Chinese city of Wuhan less than a month ago.
The World Health Organisation met on Wednesday to determine whether to declare the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern, after authorities in China confirmed the death toll had risen from six overnight.
The US reported one confirmed case of the novel coronavirus, designated 2019-nCoV, on Tuesday, and cases have also been confirmed in Korea and Thailand. It has also spread to 14 health workers in China, confirming human-to-human transmission.
But health authorities say there is no cause for public concern in Australia.
Medical staff from the New South Wales Health department will be stationed alongside biosecurity staff at Sydney airport to meet the thrice-weekly direct flight from Wuhan, conduct an initial diagnosis of any people on the flight who are exhibiting flu-like symptoms, and if necessary send them to Westmead hospital for testing.
Authorities are also providing written information, in English and Chinese, to passengers on those flights about what to do if they develop respiratory symptoms.
“ We are meeting every passenger, providing information to them, asking them to declare if they have got any symptoms, but we know that an incubation period for a virus like this could be seven days, ” Australia’ s chief medical officer, Prof Brendan Murphy, told the ABC. He said temperature scanners would not be used because they did not detect infected people who had not yet developed a fever.
“ We know in our experience in swine flu and other epidemics that measuring temperature might pick up a few people but it also misses a lot of people, and it probably doesn’ t add anything to the biosecurity measures that we’ ve put in place, ” he said.
Under Australian law airlines are obliged to report sick passengers to biosecurity staff before the plane is unloaded. Coronavirus has also been made a notifiable condition in NSW, which means the state government must be notified of suspected cases. It also means health providers can use powers under the Public Health Act 2010 to isolate or place into quarantine people who are suspected of having the virus, but are not complying with health or biosecurity officers.
“ Almost always we don’ t need to do that because people are very sensible and cooperative, but we do have powers, if need be, under the Public Health Act to control the spread of diseases, ” the NSW Health executive director, Dr Jeremy McAnulty, told reporters on Wednesday.
Most people can be relied upon to self-report unless their symptoms are so mild as to be mistakenly dismissed as a common cold, said Raina MacIntyre, a professor of global biosecurity at the University of New South Wales.
“ Most people will self-report because they will be concerned, ” MacIntyre said. “ They will know that they have come from an area of concern and people do not want to die of a serious disease. ”
Murphy said reports from China showed there “ clearly seem to be a number of mild cases that just have a fever, a bit like a common cold ”.
McAnulty said the virus did not appear to be as severe as Sars, but that it was “ prudent to be cautious until we learn more about this situation ”.
MacIntyre said severe acute respiratory syndrome ( Sars) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome ( Mers) had fatality rates of 12% and 26% respectively, while the fatality rate for the novel coronavirus was currently about 2% to 5%. But she stressed there was no formal published data yet.
One suspected case has been reported in Australia, but tests showed he did not have the coronavirus. Queensland health authorities confirmed on Tuesday that a man who had recently visited Wuhan had presented with respiratory symptoms. He was released from home isolation after Queensland Health said he no longer had flu-like symptoms, and on Wednesday afternoon it was reported that test results were negative for the virus.
Australian authorities are still developing a rapid test for the virus. A laboratory in Melbourne has developed a PCR ( polymerase chain reaction) test, using the virus sequence provided by Chinese authorities.
The incubation period for the virus is up to seven days, which means some people could be asymptomatic when assessed at the airport. Murphy said authorities did not have a “ clear clinical picture ” of whether people were infectious before they developed symptoms.
He told reporters on Tuesday that “ you can not absolutely prevent the spread of disease into the country ”.
“ So it’ s about identifying those with a high risk and making sure those who have a high risk know about it and know how to get medical attention, ” he said.
Anyone is at risk who has recently been in Wuhan, or who has had close contact with someone who has been there, and has developed flu-like symptoms, such as a high temperature, sore throat, coughing or breathlessness.
People who suspect they may have the virus are advised to ring ahead to their general practitioner or local hospital, so precautions can be taken to protect other patients from infection and appropriately triage the at-risk patient.
The biggest risk to controlling the virus, MacIntyre said, was a failure to appropriately triage.
“ We really want to focus on the healthcare system and make sure that detection is improved, ” MacIntyre said. “ You don’ t want somebody sitting in the emergency department for three hours with a cough or fever and not being properly triaged. ”
Hospitals and general practitioners have been provided with information and advice about the virus, but MacIntyre said failure to swiftly isolate at-risk patients could increase the spread of the infection.
“ We see failure of triage all the time in Australia, such as with measles, ” she said. “ You have got to look at where you can make the biggest impact and if it’ s anything like the Sars and Mers outbreaks it’ s going to be hospitals that are at the highest risk of outbreaks. ”",general
565,China coronavirus: Six questions scientists are asking,"Medical staff at a hospital in Wuhan, China, where most cases of the viral infection have occurred.

The world is racing to learn more about the
outbreak of a new viral infection
that was first detected in Wuhan, China, last month and is causing increasing alarm around the world.
As
Nature
went to press, officials in China had confirmed more than 4,500 cases of the virus, which causes a respiratory illness, and some 100 deaths. Around 50 cases had also been confirmed in other countries, in Asia, the United States and Europe.
China virus: latest news on spreading infection
Researchers fear similarities to the 2002–03 epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS), which emerged in southern China and killed 774 people in 37 countries. Both are members of a large virus family, called coronaviruses, that also includes viruses responsible for the common cold.
China has taken unprecedented action to try to halt the outbreak — including putting Wuhan and nearby cities on ‘ lockdown’, restricting travel in and out of the cities. For now, the World Health Organization ( WHO) has held off declaring a public-health emergency of international concern — the agency’ s highest level of alarm — after a meeting of officials last week, but that could change.
Nature
rounds up the questions at the heart of scientists’ efforts to understand the virus.
How does the virus spread?
This is the most urgent question surrounding the outbreak. Chinese authorities have confirmed that it spreads from person to person after identifying clusters of cases among families, as well as transmission from patients to health-care workers. Monitoring the rate at which new cases appear, and when symptoms began for each case, should reveal how easily the virus passes between humans and whether the outbreak has the potential to persist.
One figure that epidemiologists want is the number of people that someone with the virus tends to infect — known as
R
0
. An
R
0
of more than 1 means that countermeasures, such as quarantine, will be needed to contain the spread. The WHO last week published an estimated
R
0
of 1.4–2.5. Other teams suggest slightly higher values
1
,
2
. These estimates are similar to the
R
0
of SARS during the early stages of the 2002–03 outbreak, and of the novel strain of H1N1 influenza that caused a pandemic in 2009. But they are higher than
R
0
values estimated during outbreaks of the Middle East respiratory syndrome ( MERS) virus, a coronavirus similar to SARS.
“ Now it’ s in the range of these other important epidemics, and that indicates the potential that it will cause a similar scale of public-health concern if nothing else happens, ” says Mark Woolhouse, an epidemiologist at the University of Edinburgh, UK.
But researchers caution that
R
0
estimates come with large uncertainties because of gaps in the data, and the assumptions used to calculate the figure. They also point out that the
R
0
is a moving target and that estimates of the figure change over the course of an outbreak — as control measures are implemented. In the coming days, health authorities and researchers will be looking for signs that the travel restrictions in Wuhan and other Chinese cities, and other steps taken by to stem transmission, have reduced the
R
0
there.
Can infected people spread the virus without showing symptoms?
Another major unanswered question is whether — and how extensively — people without symptoms can infect others. A study
3
of a cluster of six infections in a family in Shenzhen identified a child who was infected with the virus but showed no symptoms. If such asymptomatic cases are common and these individuals can spread the virus, then containing its spread will be much more difficult, researchers say. Key to controlling the SARS virus was the fact that few cases were asymptomatic.
“ Defining the scale of asymptomatic transmission remains key: if this is a rare event then its impact should be minimal in terms of the overall outbreak, ” Jonathan Ball, a virologist at the University of Nottingham, UK, said in a statement distributed by the UK Science Media Centre. “ But, if this transmission mode is contributing significantly then control becomes increasingly difficult. ”
Stop the Wuhan virus
One way to determine whether symptom-free people can spread the virus would be to study its spread in individual households in China, says Sheila Bird, a biostatistician at the University of Cambridge, UK. By monitoring all the members of a household in which one person is infected, it should be possible to determine who else contracts the virus and how. Such studies would also be helpful for identifying ways of stopping spread in households, Bird adds.
Raina MacIntyre, an epidemiologist at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia, says that although the rise in cases probably reflects an increase in testing for and detecting the virus, the dramatic jump is concerning. “ It’ s very much a dynamic picture, and until we have an indication that cases are declining, it’ s going to continue to be of concern, ” she says.
But MacIntyre also notes that researchers are struggling to accurately model the outbreak, and to predict how it might unfold, because the case-report data being released by Chinese authorities are incomplete. “ What we need to identify is when people got sick, not when the cases were reported, and all we’ ve seen so far is when the cases were reported. ”
How deadly is the virus?
High rates of pneumonia among the first people infected had many researchers worried that the Wuhan virus was especially pernicious. Those concerns have receded slightly, as more mild cases have turned up. With some 100 deaths in more than 4,500 reported cases, the virus does not seem to be as deadly as SARS — which killed around 10% of the people it infected. But “ It’ s too early to be sanguine about the severity ”, says Neil Ferguson, a mathematical epidemiologist at Imperial College London.
Where did the virus come from?
Authorities are working on the theory that the virus originated in an unidentified animal or animals, and spread to humans at an animal and seafood market in Wuhan, which is now closed. Identification of the animal source of the virus could help officials to control the current outbreak and gauge its threat — and potentially prevent future epidemics, say researchers.
Genetic sequencing suggests that the Wuhan virus is related to
coronaviruses that circulate in bats
, including SARS and its close relatives. But other mammals can transmit these viruses — SARS was probably spread to humans by civet cats.
How quickly does the Wuhan virus spread?
The market in Wuhan also sells wild animals. And in a controversial study
4
published last week, a team of researchers in China who had performed a genetic analysis suggested that the virus jumped to humans from snakes. But other scientists were sceptical of the study, and said that there is no proof that viruses such as those behind the outbreak can infect species other than mammals and birds. “ Nothing supports snakes being involved, ” says David Robertson, a virologist at the University of Glasgow, UK.
Many researchers think that the animal host or hosts of the virus won’ t be identified without further field and laboratory work. And many hope that genetic tests of animals or environmental sources will turn up clues.
A mammal is the most likely candidate, says Cui Jie, a virologist at the Pasteur Institute of Shanghai who was part of a team that identified SARS-related viruses in bats from a cave in Yunnan province in southwestern China in 2017. SARS and the new virus are part of a subgroup known as betacoronaviruses. Fieldwork in the wake of the SARS outbreak has found such viruses only in mammals, Cui says.
What can we learn from the virus’ s genetic sequence?
Genetic sequencing of the Wuhan coronavirus offers clues to its origins and spread. Labs in China and Thailand have sequenced the genomes of more than 20 strains found in infected people and have made them publicly available. That’ s “ pretty remarkable ”, says Trevor Bedford, an evolutionary geneticist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, Washington, who is
analysing the sequences as they come in
. “ People are extremely fast and excellent about data sharing, ” he adds.
Bedford and other geneticists are using the data to determine when the virus emerged — current estimates point to November 2019. Viral sequences, Bedford adds, could identify any genetic changes that might have helped the virus make the jump from animals to humans. And if there is extensive human-to-human transmission, Bedford and other geneticists will be looking for signs that the virus has gained further mutations that are enabling it to spread more efficiently in humans.
Bedford cautions that any conclusions are preliminary, because so few data are available. “ Adding a few key samples can change the story significantly, ” he says.
Can a drug be developed to treat the coronavirus?
No drugs have been shown to be effective in treating SARS or other coronavirus infections in humans, and no vaccines aimed at preventing these infections have been licensed.
A team at China’ s National Engineering Research Center for the Emergence Drugs in Beijing is working on finding therapies that would work by blocking the receptor on human cells that the virus latches on to and uses to infect the cells. A
comparison of the SARS and new China virus sequences
, published on 16 January, found that they probably bind to the same receptor. The team is hoping to revive efforts to develop treatments for SARS and adapt them in a bid to develop a drug that could work against the latest virus.
Another researcher who has been developing drugs for coronaviruses since the SARS outbreak is hoping to
test drug candidates in animal models of the Wuhan virus
.
Chinese authorities are also testing whether existing HIV drugs can treat the infection. Ritonavir and liponavir, which are approved to treat HIV, are being given to people with pneumonia caused by the coronavirus, according to media reports and a 26 January statement by the Beijing branch of China’ s National Health Commission.",science
574,Pacific nations still reeling from measles outbreak prepare for coronavirus,"Pacific nations are ramping up security measures at ports and airports amid fears the deadly coronavirus could arrive on their shores.
There are particular fears for Samoa, which has a population of about 200,000 people and is still reeling from a devastating measles outbreak over the last few months, which killed 83 people, mostly babies. Measles was believed to have arrived in the south Pacific nation via a traveller from New Zealand.
The Samoan government announced it had a plan for coronavirus’ arrival but did not release details.
A closed-door public health meeting was held earlier this week in Samoa to discuss ways to address the potential arrival of coronavirus. Sources in the meeting told the Guardian the Faleolo International Airport is the main concern, and that senior health officials have already visited the airport to prepare for their response plan.
More than 3,400 tourists from China visited Samoa in the year to October 2019, with 490 visitors in that month alone.
The Guardian was told that the team has already prepared “ emergency gear ” for the airport screening process.
Other Pacific nations, including Papua New Guinea, Fiji and New Caledonia confirmed they are increasing security at ports.
Fiji’ s health minister, Dr Ifereimi Waqainabete, told the Fiji Times that the health protection unit met in Nadi earlier this week to discuss measures to protect Fiji, which had more than 47,000 visitors from China last year. New Caledonia has begun checking any travellers who have been to China in the last month, upon arrival in Noumea.
The coronavirus was first detected last month in the central Chinese city of Wuhan and has since spread beyond China. So far, the Sars-like virus has killed 17 people.
Chinese authorities have suspended all outbound travel from Wuhan and asked citizens not to leave the city unless there are special circumstances.
There are fears that the virus, which causes pneumonia, could have a particularly severe impact on a nation like Samoa, where so many people are recovering from measles infections and have had their immune systems compromised.
There has been criticism of the Samoan government’ s response to the measles outbreak, suggesting it was slow and led to the huge number of cases in the small nation. Altogether 5,707 cases of measles were reported to authorities since the epidemic began in October.
Experts have also pointed to the responsibility of New Zealand as the most popular gateway to Samoa to ensure that they are alert and implement safety measures from their end.
Otago University public health expert Michael Baker told RNZ: “ You can have a requirement that people do not leave on flights from New Zealand to Pacific Islands if they have respiratory illnesses that could be coronavirus, say, or in the past it could have been measles.
“ So, I think we have a huge responsibility to not export this disease to the Pacific, ” he said.",general
581,Greece elects first woman president for 'new era ',"Hi, what are you looking for?
By
Published
Greece's parliament on Wednesday elected the first woman president in the country's history, a senior judge with no party-political allegiance.
A cross-party majority of 261 of the 294 MPs present at the session voted in favour of 63-year-old Ekaterini Sakellaropoulou, parliament chief Costas Tassoulas said.
`` Ekaterini Sakellaropoulou has been elected president of the republic, '' Tassoulas said.
`` This is a very important day for the Greek republic, '' said Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, who nominated her for the post.
`` Parliament has elected a remarkable jurist, a consensus figure who symbolises the transition to a new era. ''
The new EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen agreed. Tweeting her congratulations to Sakellaropoulou, she added: `` Greece is moving ahead into a new era of equality. ''
Sakellaropoulou herself set out her priorities to assembled journalists shortly after the vote: the economic crisis, climate change and mass migration, all of which required international cooperation.
The new president, until now the head of Greece's administrative court, the Council of State, will be sworn in on March 13, taking over from Prokopis Pavlopoulos.
The daughter of a Supreme Court judge, Sakellaropoulou completed postgraduate studies at Paris's Sorbonne university. She was the first woman to lead the Council of State, the country's top administrative court.
As a jurist, she has particular expertise in environmental and constitutional law.
- A consensus candidate -
Although the president is nominally the head of the Greek state and commander-in-chief, the post is largely ceremonial.
Greek presidents confirm governments and laws and technically have the power to declare war, but only in conjunction with the government.
Backed by the main opposition leftist Syriza and socialist KINAL parties, Sakellaropoulou's candidacy secured one of the highest vote counts in parliament history.
Mitsotakis had emphasised that the selection broke with tradition not only because Sakellaropoulou is a woman, but because she is not a member of a political party.
Past presidents have often been senior party figures, such as former ministers.
Some commentators have welcomed Sakellaropoulou's nomination as a consensus candidate during a difficult time for Greek foreign policy, amid tension with Turkey over energy exploration, Aegean territorial rights and migration.
`` The time has come for Greece to open up to the future, '' Mitsotakis said earlier this month, as he submitted Sakellaropoulou's name for the parliamentary vote.
When Mitsotakis became prime minister in July, he was criticised for appointing just a handful of women to his cabinet.
A 2017 Eurobarometer poll found 63 percent of Greeks thought gender equality had been achieved in politics, 69 percent at work and 61 percent in leadership positions.
But Eurostat figures from the same year show a pay gap between men and women in Greece of more than 12 percent in average gross hourly earnings.
Unemployment is also higher among women, with one in five jobless, according to the latest official figures.
Greece’ s parliament on Wednesday elected the first woman president in the country’ s history, a senior judge with no party-political allegiance.
A cross-party majority of 261 of the 294 MPs present at the session voted in favour of 63-year-old Ekaterini Sakellaropoulou, parliament chief Costas Tassoulas said.
“ Ekaterini Sakellaropoulou has been elected president of the republic, ” Tassoulas said.
“ This is a very important day for the Greek republic, ” said Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, who nominated her for the post.
“ Parliament has elected a remarkable jurist, a consensus figure who symbolises the transition to a new era. ”
The new EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen agreed. Tweeting her congratulations to Sakellaropoulou, she added: “ Greece is moving ahead into a new era of equality. ”
Sakellaropoulou herself set out her priorities to assembled journalists shortly after the vote: the economic crisis, climate change and mass migration, all of which required international cooperation.
The new president, until now the head of Greece’ s administrative court, the Council of State, will be sworn in on March 13, taking over from Prokopis Pavlopoulos.
The daughter of a Supreme Court judge, Sakellaropoulou completed postgraduate studies at Paris’ s Sorbonne university. She was the first woman to lead the Council of State, the country’ s top administrative court.
As a jurist, she has particular expertise in environmental and constitutional law.
– A consensus candidate –
Although the president is nominally the head of the Greek state and commander-in-chief, the post is largely ceremonial.
Greek presidents confirm governments and laws and technically have the power to declare war, but only in conjunction with the government.
Backed by the main opposition leftist Syriza and socialist KINAL parties, Sakellaropoulou’ s candidacy secured one of the highest vote counts in parliament history.


Mitsotakis had emphasised that the selection broke with tradition not only because Sakellaropoulou is a woman, but because she is not a member of a political party.
Past presidents have often been senior party figures, such as former ministers.
Some commentators have welcomed Sakellaropoulou’ s nomination as a consensus candidate during a difficult time for Greek foreign policy, amid tension with Turkey over energy exploration, Aegean territorial rights and migration.
“ The time has come for Greece to open up to the future, ” Mitsotakis said earlier this month, as he submitted Sakellaropoulou’ s name for the parliamentary vote.
When Mitsotakis became prime minister in July, he was criticised for appointing just a handful of women to his cabinet.
A 2017 Eurobarometer poll found 63 percent of Greeks thought gender equality had been achieved in politics, 69 percent at work and 61 percent in leadership positions.
But Eurostat figures from the same year show a pay gap between men and women in Greece of more than 12 percent in average gross hourly earnings.
Unemployment is also higher among women, with one in five jobless, according to the latest official figures.

594,"Southeast Asia stocks: Most subdued ahead of holidays, Philippines gains 1%","Philippine stocks saw their best day in almost three weeks after falling over 2% so far this week.
`` I would look into the performance over the last few days, which is mostly weak, so today's bounce back mostly looks like bargain hunting from investors, '' said Charles William Ang, associate analyst at COL Financial Group.
Gains in financial and consumer sectors helped prop up Philippines. Real estate developer Ayala Land advanced 2.3%, while packaged food producer Universal Robina Corp rose 1.2%.
The Philippine central bank said gross domestic product ( GDP) growth of 7% was attainable for 2020, while data showed December quarter GDP up 6.4% year-on-year.
Other markets in southeast Asia were subdued as the death toll from the coronavirus rose to 17, while the World Health Organization ( WHO) said it will decide on Thursday whether to declare a global emergency over the outbreak.
Malaysian shares were lower, hurt by losses in the healthcare and consumer sectors.
Latex glove manufacturer Hartalega Holdings fell 1.7%, while plantation co Kuala Lumpur Kepong lost 1.2%.
Indonesian stocks edged slightly higher, helped by gains in consumer stocks and ahead of a central bank policy meeting later in the day.
A Reuters poll showed Bank Indonesia was likely to hold rates, while the central bank governor has promised to continue on a `` accommodative monetary policy ''.
A surprise rate cut by Malaysia's central bank yesterday might `` give Bank Indonesia additional confidence to lower its policy rate, '' Mizuho Bank said in a note to clients.

598,Australians warned the wet weather brings out funnel-web spiders,"Hi, what are you looking for?
By
Published
The Australian Reptile Park in Somersby, in New South Wales state, has warned the public through its Facebook page that recent wet weather, followed by hot days, has created “ perfect conditions for funnel-web spiders to thrive. ”
Native to the moist regions of Eastern Australia, there are more than 30 species of funnel-web spider but the Sydney funnel-web spider, atrax robustus, has the distinction of holding the Guinness World Record for the most venomous spider in the world.
“ Because of the recent rain and now the hot days we are now experiencing, funnel-web spiders will start to move around, ” park spokesman Daniel Rumsey said in a video posted on Facebook, per CTV News Canada.
“ Funnel-web spiders are potentially one of the most dangerous spiders on the planet, in terms of a bite towards humans, and we have to treat it very seriously. ”
At least 28 people have died in the worst bushfires Australia has seen in decades. The fires were followed by torrential rains, hail and flooding, which created new risks. Last week, parts of southeastern Australia were pelted by hailstones the size of golf balls, big enough to smash car windows and injure birds, less than 24 hours after the region was hit by massive dust storms.
The Australian Reptile Park welcomes the arrival of the deadly spiders, though. They are the only maker of funnel-web antivenom. They need the live spiders’ venom. Since the anti-venom program began in the early 1980s, there has not been a single funnel-web related death since, reports The Guardian.
The funnel-webs have arrived later than usual, according to Warren Bailey, owner of ABC Pest Control Sydney. They usually come out in the summer, but Bailey says the hot, drought-like conditions over the past few months delayed the spider season late.
“ Their venom is pretty toxic and can kill someone, ” he said. “ The funnel-webs are now out with the recent rains, ( and) they can go into people’ s houses on the ground or from the roof. ”

599,Treasury yields rise as investors monitor earnings and virus development,"Treasury yields fell slightly on Wednesday as investors flocked back into risk assets, after China unveiled measures to rein in the spread of a deadly virus.
The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note, which moves inversely to price, was higher at around 1.7778%, while the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond rose to 2.2351%.
The outbreak of a new strain of coronavirus in China's Wuhan region sent Treasury yields to a two-week low on Tuesday, with experts calling back the economic fallout from the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome ( SARS) crisis in 2003. Fears of a global pandemic sent investors running for safety and saw stock markets tumble.
However, China on Wednesday announced sweeping measures to contain the virus, which has killed nine people and infected more than 400. A first U.S. case was confirmed Tuesday in Washington State, but health officials have said the affected individual `` poses little risk '' to the public.
Investors continued to monitor corporate earnings. IBM forecast full-year profit above market expectations on Tuesday, sending its shares higher, while United Airlines beat Wall Street quarterly profit expectations despite ongoing delays to the Boeing 737 Max aircraft.
Yields gained slightly after data showed U.S. home sales easily beat expectations, jumping to a nearly 2-year high. U.S. home sales increased 3.6% in December to a seasonally adjusted 5.54 million. Economists polled by Reuters expected a gain of 1.3% to 5.43 million units sold.

617,Snakes could be the original source of the new coronavirus outbreak in China,"Editor’ s note: Since publication of this article, the World Health Organization has said that there is “ no conclusive evidence ” that snakes were the source of the virus, although the exact viral intermediate host remains unknown.
Snakes – the Chinese krait and the Chinese cobra – may be the original source of the newly discovered coronavirus that has triggered an outbreak of a deadly infectious respiratory illness in China this winter.
The illness was first reported in late December 2019 in Wuhan, a major city in central China, and has been rapidly spreading. Since then, sick travelers from Wuhan have infected people in China and other countries, including the United States.
Using samples of the virus isolated from patients, scientists in China have determined the genetic code of the virus and used microscopes to photograph it. The pathogen responsible for this pandemic is a new coronavirus. It’ s in the same family of viruses as the well-known severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( MERS-CoV), which have killed hundreds of people in the past 17 years. The World Health Organization ( WHO) has named the new coronavirus 2019-nCoV.
We are virologists and journal editors and are closely following this outbreak because there are many questions that need to be answered to curb the spread of this public health threat.
The name of coronavirus comes from its shape, which resembles a crown or solar corona when imaged using an electron microscope.
Coronavirus is transmitted through the air and primarily infects the upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tract of mammals and birds. Though most of the members of the coronavirus family only cause mild flu-like symptoms during infection, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can infect both upper and lower airways and cause severe respiratory illness and other complications in humans.
This new 2019-nCoV causes similar symptoms to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. People infected with these coronaviruses suffer a severe inflammatory response.
Unfortunately, there is no approved vaccine or antiviral treatment available for coronavirus infection. A better understanding of the life cycle of 2019-nCoV, including the source of the virus, how it is transmitted and how it replicates are needed to both prevent and treat the disease.
Both SARS and MERS are classified as zoonotic viral diseases, meaning the first patients who were infected acquired these viruses directly from animals. This was possible because while in the animal host, the virus had acquired a series of genetic mutations that allowed it to infect and multiply inside humans.
Now these viruses can be transmitted from person to person. Field studies have revealed that the original source of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV is the bat, and that the masked palm civets ( a mammal native to Asia and Africa) and camels, respectively, served as intermediate hosts between bats and humans.
In the case of this 2019 coronavirus outbreak, reports state that most of the first group of patients hospitalized were workers or customers at a local seafood wholesale market which also sold processed meats and live consumable animals including poultry, donkeys, sheep, pigs, camels, foxes, badgers, bamboo rats, hedgehogs and reptiles. However, since no one has ever reported finding a coronavirus infecting aquatic animals, it is plausible that the coronavirus may have originated from other animals sold in that market.
The hypothesis that the 2019-nCoV jumped from an animal at the market is strongly supported by a new publication in the Journal of Medical Virology. The scientists conducted an analysis and compared the genetic sequences of 2019-nCoV and all other known coronaviruses.
The study of the genetic code of 2019-nCoV reveals that the new virus is most closely related to two bat SARS-like coronavirus samples from China, initially suggesting that, like SARS and MERS, the bat might also be the origin of 2019-nCoV. The authors further found that the viral RNA coding sequence of 2019-nCoV spike protein, which forms the “ crown ” of the virus particle that recognizes the receptor on a host cell, indicates that the bat virus might have mutated before infecting people.
But when the researchers performed a more detailed bioinformatics analysis of the sequence of 2019-nCoV, it suggests that this coronavirus might come from snakes.
The researchers used an analysis of the protein codes favored by the new coronavirus and compared it to the protein codes from coronaviruses found in different animal hosts, like birds, snakes, marmots, hedgehogs, manis, bats and humans. Surprisingly, they found that the protein codes in the 2019-nCoV are most similar to those used in snakes.
Snakes often hunt for bats in wild. Reports indicate that snakes were sold in the local seafood market in Wuhan, raising the possibility that the 2019-nCoV might have jumped from the host species – bats – to snakes and then to humans at the beginning of this coronavirus outbreak. However, how the virus could adapt to both the cold-blooded and warm-blooded hosts remains a mystery.
The authors of the report and other researchers must verify the origin of the virus through laboratory experiments. Searching for the 2019-nCoV sequence in snakes would be the first thing to do. However, since the outbreak, the seafood market has been disinfected and shut down, which makes it challenging to trace the new virus’ source animal.
Sampling viral RNA from animals sold at the market and from wild snakes and bats is needed to confirm the origin of the virus. Nonetheless, the reported findings will also provide insights for developing prevention and treatment protocols.
The 2019-nCoV outbreak is another reminder that people should limit the consumption of wild animals to prevent zoonotic infections.
This article has been updated to clarify that the genetic material from the virus was RNA, not DNA.

621,Libya's neighbours reject foreign interference in crisis-hit country,"Hi, what are you looking for?
By
Published
Libya's neighbours on Thursday denounced foreign interference in the conflict-hit North African country, at talks in Algiers to seek a political solution to a crisis they say threatens regional stability.
The meeting organised at Algeria's initiative brought together foreign ministers from Tunisia, Egypt, Chad and Mali, as well as diplomats from Sudan and Niger.
The participants insisted on the `` need to respect Libya as a united country and to respect the sovereignty of its legitimate authorities, '' Algerian Foreign Minister Sabri Boukadoum said after the talks.
They also rejected `` any foreign interference in Libya '' and urged all sides there `` to solve their conflict by peaceful means '', Boukadoum added.
`` We are confident that the Libyan people will be capable of overcoming their differences through dialogue... and reaching a political solution, '' he said, adding that the African Union and the United Nations should be a part of a solution.
A statement at the end of the talks said the foreign ministers `` exhorted the Libyan belligerents to engage in a dialogue under the auspices of the United Nations and with the help of the African Union and Libya's neighbours in order to reach a global settlement away from any foreign interference ''.
`` Foreign interference only prolongs the crisis and makes it more complex, '' they warned.
The Algiers talks came days after an international summit hosted by Germany in Berlin during which world leaders committed to end foreign meddling in Libya and to uphold a weapons embargo.
German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas briefed the Algiers meeting on the results of Sunday's Berlin talks, then made a brief stop in Tunis on his way home.
Several African countries had complained at not being invited to the Berlin conference. Boukadoum said the Algiers talks were aimed at `` making the voices of Libya's neighbours heard '' by the international community.
Tunisia, which like Algeria shares a long border with Libya, was not invited to Berlin but Maas, in a statement released by the Tunisian presidency, said Tunis would be involved in future efforts to try and end the Libyan conflict.
- 'Algerian mediation ' -
Libya has been torn by fighting between rival armed factions since NATO-backed insurgents toppled and killed dictator Moamer Kadhafi in 2011.
Two rival administrations have emerged from the chaos.
Since April last year, the UN-recognised Government of National Accord ( GNA) in Tripoli has fought back against an offensive by fighters loyal to military strongman Khalifa Haftar who draws his legitimacy from an administration based in the country's east.
Haftar is supported by several countries including Russia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and France, while the GNA has the backing of Turkey and Qatar.
GNA head Fayez al-Sarraj and Haftar refused to meet in Berlin and did not take part in the Algeria talks.
On Tuesday the UN Security Council urged Libya's warring parties to reach a long-term deal paving the way for a political process aimed at ending the conflict.
`` The current situation in Libya can not withstand an escalation, '' Boukadoum said as the meeting got underway on Thursday with statements from each participant.
Algeria shares a border of almost 1,000 kilometres ( 620 miles) with Libya.
Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, who attended the Berlin summit, said Wednesday: `` Peace in Libya is equal to peace '' in Algeria.
`` There are statements from Sarraj, statements from Haftar's side, which indicate that the only power capable of settling the problem is Algeria. We have their trust, '' he added.
Russian President Vladimir Putin called Thursday for a summit of leaders of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council to `` defend peace '' in the face of global instability, and suggested Libya could be on the agenda.
On the ground in the North African country, tensions remained high.
Late Wednesday, Tripoli's sole functioning airport was closed for several hours following a rocket strike the GNA blamed on Haftar's forces, briefly re-opened and then closed again after their rivals threatened air traffic over the capital.
But on Thursday the GNA reopened Mitiga and said it would raise the issue of Haftar's threats at the UN Security Council.

659,WHO officials try to contain China coronavirus — as well as public fears,"World health officials hesitated Wednesday to designate an outbreak of a flu-like coronavirus that's killed at least 17 people as a global emergency, trying to contain the fast-spreading illness without unnecessarily spooking global trade.
The World Health Organization is set to reconvene Thursday after an emergency committee of international health experts were split on deciding whether the virus should be classified as a `` public health emergency of international concern, '' Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told journalists. That gives the organization the power to set temporary recommendations to coordinate a global health response with its 196 member countries, including the United States.
The previously unknown, flu-like coronavirus strain sent a chill through global markets this week. It's believed to have emerged from an animal market in central Wuhan city, China with cases now detected across Asia and as far away as the United States. Deaths from China's new virus rose to 17 on Wednesday with 571 confirmed cases so far, increasing fears of contagion from an infection suspected to originate from illegally traded wildlife.
Stay up to date with the latest on the coronavirus outbreak news here.
WHO physicians said they needed more data before declaring a global emergency, but the virus is now spreading through close human contact and in health-care settings, they said. One of the criteria used to determine whether it's an international threat is whether the disease spreads locally once it arrives in new parts of the world, `` and that's a nuanced and important distinction to make, '' Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director of WHO's health emergencies programme, said on the call.
The other main criteria is whether it's already interfered or will likely interfere with trade and travel, he said. The WHO committee's goal, he said is to contain an outbreak without needlessly disrupting economic activity just by declaring a global health crisis.
`` There's a balance here to be struck and that balance is something the emergency committee tries to address in their advice to the director general, '' he said.
The impact on global trade and travel was felt from Beijing to Seattle — where a U.S. traveler was under quarantine with the virus in a Snohomish County, Washington hospital after flying back from Wuhan, U.S. health officials said Tuesday. U.S. health officials said they would begin screenings at major airports in Chicago and Atlanta, in addition to the screenings underway at Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York airports, in an attempt to control the spread.
Fears that the coronavirus could disrupt travel and commerce and slow economic growth sent a chill through global markets this week, hitting Asian stocks hard as investors grew concerned that the country's Lunar New Year holiday, which begins Saturday, could worsen the spread as millions of Chinese nationals travel domestically and abroad. Confirmation of the first U.S. case Tuesday depressed copper and oil prices, sending investors into safe havens, such as U.S. Treasurys and German bunds. Goldman Sachs predicted that the outbreak could shave $ 3 from oil prices due to a slowdown in air travel.
Already, across China, companies from Foxconn to Huawei Technologies and HSBC Holdings were handing out masks and warning staff to avoid Wuhan. Terry Gou, the billionaire founder of Apple supplier Foxconn, said he was advising employees not to visit China.
Some major U.S. companies, including General Motors and Ford, announced that they would also temporarily restrict employee travel and reports from Chinese state media that government officials in Wuhan were suspending all public transportation and asking residents to not leave the city due to the outbreak likely didn't help ease fears.
Physicians have compared the outbreak to the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, which had a short incubation period of two to seven days. At the time, WHO officials said it was less infectious than the flu. While there were just eight confirmed cases in the U.S., it infected 8,098 people and killed 774.
SARS, however, didn't spread as fast in its first few weeks as the current coronavirus outbreak, according to WHO data. It took almost two months for SARS to spread to 456 people. By comparison, the 2019 coronavirus has already infected more than 571 people in less than a month.
WHO officials said the mortality rate from the new virus, is 3.8% as of Wednesday, which is low compared to other outbreaks. WHO officials have investigators on the ground in China gathering more data, which committee members said they need before calling it a global health emergency. The SARS outbreak two decades ago had a mortality rate of about 10%.
They said scientists are building on research and development advancements that have been made from the last outbreaks and could be applicable here.
WHO doesn't enact the emergencies lightly, health experts say. The last time WHO declared a global health emergency was in 2019 for the Ebola outbreak in eastern Congo that killed more than 2,000 people. The agency also declared global emergencies for the 2016 Zika virus, the 2009 H1N1 swine flu and the 2014 polio and Ebola outbreaks.

675,Oil Prices Head Lower Despite Small Crude Draw,"Crude oil prices were stubbornly down following the Energy Information Administration reported a modest crude oil inventory draw of 400,000 barrels for the week to January 17. This compared with analyst expectations of a 1.117-million-barrel inventory decline and a draw of 2.5 million barrels reported a week earlier. Last week, however, oil prices were pressured by the EIA & rsquo; s reporting of hefty builds in both gasoline and distillate fuel. For last week, the authority reported a build in gasoline, of 1.7 million barrels, and a 1.2-million-barrel decline in distillate fuel inventories. This compared with a build of 6.7 million barrels in gasoline inventories a week earlier and an 8.2-million-barrel increase in distillate fuels. Gasoline production last week averaged 9.5 million bpd, versus 9.3 million bpd a week earlier. Distillate fuel production stood at 5.0 million bpd, down from 5.2 million bpd a week earlier. At the time of writing both Brent crude and West Texas Intermediate were trending lower after on Wednesday they closed at a seven-week low, pressured by concern about oversupply stemming from slackening demand. The demand decline is expected to be brought about by a drop in jet fuel demand as the coronavirus outbreak in China discourages travel for the Chinese New Year specifically and air travel in general. Comments from authorities are not helping either. The head of the International Energy Agency, Fatih Birol, said at the World Economic Forum in Davos that he expected abundant supply to continue offsetting the potential price positive effect of production outages and political events in the Middle East. The EIA itself earlier this week said it expected crude oil production in the shale patch to continue increasing, adding 22,000 bpd next month to reach a total 9.2 million bpd. The increase will come from the Permian and the Bakken, which will together add 50,000 bpd to their daily average, more than offsetting declines across the rest of the shale patch. At the time of writing, Brent crude traded at $ 61.48 a barrel, with WTI at $ 55.05 per barrel. Both were down from opening, by nearly 3%.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.com",business
697,Chinese stocks just had their worst day in more than eight months as the coronavirus spreads,"China's Shanghai Composite ( SHCOMP) closed down 2.75% Thursday afternoon. It's the index's worst single-day percentage drop since last May, when President Donald Trump threatened new tariffs on China.
Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index ( HSI) closed down 1.5%. The benchmark has lost about 4% so far this week.
Japan's Nikkei 225 ( N225) slumped 1%, while South Korea's Kospi ( KOSPI) decreased 0.9%.
China's coronavirus problem is getting worse. The death toll from the disease has jumped to 17. More than 500 people have been infected, mostly in mainland China, though the disease has spread as far as the United States. The World Health Organization could decide Thursday whether the spread of the virus constitutes `` a public health emergency of international concern. ''
Asian markets crept up slightly Wednesday, even as the virus spread. But losses are now deepening: The outbreak coincides with the Lunar New Year, during which time millions of people are traveling throughout the region.
Medical supplier stocks have continued to surge, though: Shares of Zhende Medical and Jiangsu Nanfang Medical spiked 10% in Shanghai, the daily maximum limit.
A blow to the travel sector
China's travel industry in particular is bracing for disruption. The country's airline regulator has instructed Chinese carriers to offer passengers booked on Wuhan flights free cancellations if requested, while state media has cited China's rail authorities as saying they are offering free cancellations to passengers booked on Wuhan trains.
The country's aviation sector is `` likely to remain under pressure, '' Andrew Lee, an equity analyst at Jefferies, wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday. Shares of China Southern Airlines — which Lee estimated accounts for 30% of the flights in and out of Wuhan — dropped more than 3.5% in Hong Kong and Shanghai on Thursday.
Other major airlines, including Air China and China Eastern, also fell Thursday.
Meanwhile, Cathay Pacific ( CPCAY) stock declined 2.1% in Hong Kong. Shares of the carrier, which serves as Hong Kong's flagship airline, have already lost almost 12% this year, as ongoing protests fuel a drop in tourism.
The pain is expected to continue. `` If the effect on regional travel is similar to that during the SARS outbreak in 2003, passenger volumes between Asian destinations — particularly China — and Australia could be significantly affected over the next [ two to three ] quarters, '' analysts at Moody's Investors Service said in a report Thursday.
Oil prices could also take a hit, since the anticipated decline in regional travel may bring down jet fuel prices, analysts at Goldman Sachs said in a note this week.
Looking back at SARS
The outbreak is reminiscent of SARS, the respiratory virus that infected more than 8,000 people and killed 774 in a pandemic that ripped through Asia and spread as far as Canada nearly two decades ago. The Wuhan virus is from the same family as SARS.
Larry Hu, an economist at Macquarie Capital, noted Wednesday that the SARS outbreak dented China's quarterly GDP growth in 2003. Though he added that the economy rebounded as the virus faded away.
`` We have come a long way from SARS in 2003, '' said Jeffrey Halley, a senior market analyst for Asia Pacific at Oanda, wrote in a note to clients on Thursday. He said the slump in Asian markets `` looks more precautionary than panic-driven. ''
Markets in China will be closed for a week starting Friday, which marks the eve of the Lunar New Year.",business
705,Snakes could be the original source of the new coronavirus outbreak in China,"The many-banded krait ( Bungarus multicinctus), also known as the Taiwanese krait or the Chinese krait, is a highly venomous species of elapid snake found in much of central and southern China and Southeast Asia.
The illness was first reported in late December 2019 in Wuhan, a major city in central China, and has been rapidly spreading. Since then, sick travelers from Wuhan have infected people in China and other countries, including the United States.
Using samples of the virus isolated from patients, scientists in China have determined the genetic code of the virus and used microscopes to photograph it. The pathogen responsible for this pandemic is a new coronavirus. It's in the same family of viruses as the well-known severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( MERS-CoV), which have killed hundreds of people in the past 17 years. The World Health Organization ( WHO) has named the new coronavirus 2019-nCoV.
We are virologists and journal editors and are closely following this outbreak because there are many questions that need to be answered to curb the spread of this public health threat.
What is a coronavirus?
The name of coronavirus comes from its shape, which resembles a crown or solar corona when imaged using an electron microscope.
The electron microscopic image, reveals the crown shape structural details for which the coronavirus was named. This image is of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( MERS-CoV). National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases ( NIAID)
Coronavirus is transmitted through the air and primarily infects the upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tract of mammals and birds. Though most of the members of the coronavirus family only cause mild flu-like symptoms during infection, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can infect both upper and lower airways and cause severe respiratory illness and other complications in humans.
This new 2019-nCoV causes similar symptoms to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. People infected with these coronaviruses suffer a severe inflammatory response.
Unfortunately, there is no approved vaccine or antiviral treatment available for coronavirus infection. A better understanding of the life cycle of 2019-nCoV, including the source of the virus, how it is transmitted and how it replicates are needed to both prevent and treat the disease.
Read: What exactly is a coronavirus?
Zoonotic transmission
Both SARS and MERS are classified as zoonotic viral diseases, meaning the first patients who were infected acquired these viruses directly from animals. This was possible because while in the animal host, the virus had acquired a series of genetic mutations that allowed it to infect and multiply inside humans.
Now these viruses can be transmitted from person to person. Field studies have revealed that the original source of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV is the bat, and that the masked palm civets ( a mammal native to Asia and Africa) and camels, respectively, served as intermediate hosts between bats and humans.
In the case of this 2019 coronavirus outbreak, reports state that most of the first group of patients hospitalized were workers or customers at a local seafood wholesale market which also sold processed meats and live consumable animals including poultry, donkeys, sheep, pigs, camels, foxes, badgers, bamboo rats, hedgehogs and reptiles. However, since no one has ever reported finding a coronavirus infecting aquatic animals, it is plausible that the coronavirus may have originated from other animals sold in that market.
The hypothesis that the 2019-nCoV jumped from an animal at the market is strongly supported by a new publication in the Journal of Medical Virology. The scientists conducted an analysis and compared the genetic sequences of 2019-nCoV and all other known coronaviruses.
The study of the genetic code of 2019-nCoV reveals that the new virus is most closely related to two bat SARS-like coronavirus samples from China, initially suggesting that, like SARS and MERS, the bat might also be the origin of 2019-nCoV. The authors further found that the viral RNA coding sequence of 2019-nCoV spike protein, which forms the `` crown '' of the virus particle that recognizes the receptor on a host cell, indicates that the bat virus might have mutated before infecting people.
How influenza jumped from animals to humans
But when the researchers performed a more detailed bioinformatics analysis of the sequence of 2019-nCoV, it suggests that this coronavirus might come from snakes.
The Wuhan Huanan Wholesale Seafood Market, where the coronavirus outbreak is believed to have started, is now closed.
From bats to snakes
The researchers used an analysis of the protein codes favored by the new coronavirus and compared it to the protein codes from coronaviruses found in different animal hosts, like birds, snakes, marmots, hedgehogs, manis, bats and humans. Surprisingly, they found that the protein codes in the 2019-nCoV are most similar to those used in snakes.
Snakes often hunt for bats in wild. Reports indicate that snakes were sold in the local seafood market in Wuhan, raising the possibility that the 2019-nCoV might have jumped from the host species -- bats -- to snakes and then to humans at the beginning of this coronavirus outbreak. However, how the virus could adapt to both the cold-blooded and warm-blooded hosts remains a mystery.
The authors of the report and other researchers must verify the origin of the virus through laboratory experiments. Searching for the 2019-nCoV sequence in snakes would be the first thing to do. However, since the outbreak, the seafood market has been disinfected and shut down, which makes it challenging to trace the new virus ' source animal.
3 reasons the US is not ready for a pandemic
Sampling viral RNA from animals sold at the market and from wild snakes and bats is needed to confirm the origin of the virus. Nonetheless, the reported findings will also provide insights for developing prevention and treatment protocols.
The 2019-nCoV outbreak is another reminder that people should limit the consumption of wild animals to prevent zoonotic infections.

723,Molson Coors buys craft beer maker Atwater Brewery,"As beer makers grapple with a slowdown in their iconic brews, one area they have tapped into for growth is craft. While the increase in craft sales may not be as robust as a few years ago, it continues to far outpace outpace beer overall. Beer volume slipped 2.3% in 2019, its fourth straight year of declines, led by a 3.6% drop in domestic brews, IWSR said, while craft beer consumption increased 4.1%.
This growth is a major reason why big beer companies such as Molson Coors and its competitors continue to snap up these upstarts known for clever names and new flavors brewed using ingredients typically not associated with beer.
AB InBev announced in August that it acquired Platform Beer, a fast-growing regional brewery founded in Cleveland in 2014. Then, three months later it purchased the 68.8% stake it didn't own in Craft Brew Alliance for about $ 321 million. And last year, the Boston Beer Company, the manufacturer of Sam Adams, announced it would buy craft-beer maker Dogfish Head Brewery for $ 300 million in an effort to keep pace with `` an intense amount of consolidation among many craft breweries in the U.S., '' most notably the sale of many of them to large international beer giants.
The decision by Atwater to sell itself to Molson Coors is as much a reflection of the challenges facing Big Beer as it is those in the increasingly crowded craft beer space. This segment had more than 7,300 craft players in 2018, nearly double the amount in the U.S. four years earlier, according to data from the Brewers Association.
With so many brewers around, it's no longer enough just to be in the craft space to guarantee success. A growing number of craft players are going out of business or finding it hard to compete or find the financial firepower to expand their distribution into other regions where a local competitor already is entrenched in the area. This was the primary reason Atwater decided to sell itself rather than forge ahead on its own.
`` The competition has gotten a lot stiffer, '' Atwater owner Mark Rieth told The Detroit News. `` Our growth required capital and craft beverage expertise. All ( Molson Coors wants) to do is support us and bring our brand to the next level. ''
Molson Coors has been overhauling its portfolio to reflect a consumer shift away from its classic brews, such as Miller Lite and Molson Coors, toward spirits, craft beers or ready-to-drink products like hard seltzer. As part of the Atwater purchase, Molson Coors is adding the craft maker's hard seltzers and craft spirits to its existing offerings.​
After another quarter of falling sales in the U.S., which accounts for two-thirds of its revenue, Molson Coors announced sweeping changes to its business in October that included cutting hundreds of jobs, a change in its corporate structure and a decision to drop the word `` Brewing '' from its name and replace it with `` Beverage '' in an effort `` to better reflect its strategic intent to expand beyond beer and into other growth adjacencies. '' It also is testing a La Colombe cold brew with the addition of an alcoholic malt in four markets, and in November it purchased a stake in L.A. Libations, a nonalcoholic beverage incubator.
While these changes could indicate that beer is no longer a key focus of Molson Coors, a company spokesman told Food Dive last week that is not the case. Molson Coors is `` doubling down '' on its core brews even as the company simultaneously broadens its portfolio to make sure it can respond to a shift in consumer trends. In just a few short months, Molson Coors has made major changes to its portfolio, highlighted most recently by the Atwater acquisition. But like its competitors, it can't afford to ease up, meaning further deals in craft and other niches in alcohol are inevitable in 2020 and beyond.

Founded in 1997, Atwater Brewery is known in Michigan craft beer community for its traditional German-style lagers and ales. Its top beers include Dirty Blonde, Vanilla Java Porter, Better Life Choices and Decadent Dark Chocolate. The brewer, which also produces hard seltzers and craft spirits, also operates three taphouse and biergarden locations in Detroit, Grosse Pointe Park and Grand Rapids.
Mark Rieth, owner of Atwater Brewery, says Tenth and Blake will help the brewery expand. `` For Atwater to continue to grow, it will require both capital and brewing expertise. Tenth and Blake brings both, which makes them the ideal strategic partner to help us continue to live our mantra 'Born in Detroit. Raised Everywhere. ' '' ​ Rieth and his management team will continue to lead Atwater's day-to-day operations.
Tenth and Blake says it will help the brewery develop its core markets and then expand across the Great Lakes region. Other craft brands in its portfolio include the Jacob Leinenkugel Brewing Company, AC Golden Brewing Company, Saint Archer Brewing Company, Terrapin Beer Company, Hop Valley Brewing Company and Revolver Brewing.
Tenth and Blake’ s regional crafts posted volume growth of more than 15% in 2019, while the overall craft segment was just above flat.
Not only does today’ s acquisition of @ atwaterbeer build on our successful model of growing regional crafts, it is a clear indication of how serious we are about our plans to invest across our entire portfolio as we revitalize @ MolsonCoors. https: //t.co/z1BPEWi1jt
Molson Coors says the acquisition is an example of how it is executing its revitalization plan, ​​ which was launched in October 2019 to generate and reinvest savings. It has also taken a stake in beverage incubator L.A. Libations; ​​ announced it will air ads during the pro football championship for the first time in years; and launched new creative campaigns for a range of brands.",general
754,Disney closes Shanghai park as deadly coronavirus spreads,"Shanghai Disney Resort made the announcement on its official website on Friday, saying the closure was `` in response to the prevention and control of the disease outbreak. ''
The resort said it will refund guests for admission fees, hotel bookings and other pre-purchased entertainment tickets. It did not say when the park would reopen.

The disease, which originated in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, has already left dozens of people dead and more than 800 infected as it spreads throughout Asia and as far as the United States. At least 10 cities in central Hubei province are facing travel restrictions, including Wuhan. Major cities including Beijing have canceled some or all major Lunar New Year celebrations — a rare, drastic step to reign in the spread of the virus.
Disney ( DIS) opened its $ 5.5 billion Shanghai resort in 2016 with much fanfare, including speeches from top Chinese officials.
But the mega theme park has struggled to win over China's cost-conscious consumers, and there have reportedly been several complaints about its ticketing policy and food and beverage prices.
Disney said in November that the Shanghai resort saw an uptick in revenue in its fiscal fourth quarter, but higher average ticket prices resulted in `` lower attendance '' compared to the same period a year earlier.
The closure comes less than two weeks after Shanghai Disney Resort unveiled a series of events tailored for China's Year of the Rat. The park had completed a `` festive makeover '' to usher in what it called the `` Year of the Mouse. '' It launched new holiday festivities, new merchandise, Lunar New Year dining options and made new outfits for Mickey, Minnie and other Disney mascots.
Other popular tourist attractions, such as the Forbidden City in Beijing, have been shut down in China due to concerns over the Wuhan virus.
More entertainment venues will also feel the hit as people stay indoors and avoid crowded areas.
China's National Center for the Performing Arts announced on Friday that all performances scheduled between Jan 26th to 30th were canceled. Other venues followed. Beijing People's Art Theater said it would close on the 24th and did not give a date when it would reopen. Nanjing Jiangsu Theater canceled 9 performances.
Chinese state news agency Xinhua reported on Thursday that blockbuster movies that were set to release during China's lucrative Lunar New Year holiday have been pulled.
Producers and distributors canceled or postponed all seven Chinese movies — many of them big franchise series films — that were due to hit theaters this weekend, citing the lack of ventilation in movie theaters and the highly contagious nature of the coronavirus.
Ticketing platforms, such as Maoyan, Damai, and Taopiaopiao, said they will refund all tickets that had been pre-purchased by customers.
Leading cinema chain brands, including Jinyi, CGV, Bona, announced before Lunar New Year's eve that they would be shutting down during the peak holiday season in response to the coronavirus outbreak.
Wanda Cinema, China's largest film distributor with over 500 cinemas across the country, said it would refund tickets for those who chose not to go the movies.
The holiday is a big draw for moviegoers. Last year, China's Lunar New Year box office pulled in more than 5 billion yuan ( $ 720.8 million), according to Xinhua.

770,Leftovers: Halo Top does keto; craft beer taps into the oat milk craze,"The ice cream pint that revolutionized the category is at it again for dieters who want to indulge, and Silk whips the dairy alternative market with its new heavy cream offering.
Leftovers is our look at a few of the product ideas popping up everywhere — some are intriguing, some sound amazing and some are the kinds of ideas we would never dream of. We can't write about everything that we get pitched, so here are the leftovers pulled from our inboxes.
Everyone’ s getting into the keto diet these days, it seems — including Halo Top.
The low-calorie ice cream brand that first disrupted the frozen dessert case a few years ago is the latest food to make its way into keto eating — the high protein and fat and low carbohydrate diet designed for quick weight loss.
Halo Top has seven flavors in its new Keto Series: Peanut Butter Chocolate, Jelly Donut, Caramel Butter Pecan, Berry Swirl, Chocolate Cheesecake, Banana Cream Pie, and White Chocolaty Macadamia Nut. Each pint has 5 to 10 net carbs and 410 to 630 calories per pint.
And because the number of carbs matters most on the keto diet, the number printed on each pint’ s ice cream scoop is carbs per pint — not calories, like regular Halo Top.
`` Our brand is focused on making delicious dessert that everyone can feel good about eating, and these new flavors allow us to do that for our fans looking to limit their sugar intake, '' Meg Graeff, senior brand manager for Halo Top, said in the press release.
As consumers’ calendars turned to 2020, interest in the keto diet surged. According to Google Trends, searches for the term more than doubled between the last week of 2019 and the beginning of January. Given the perpetual resolution to lose weight in the new year, the newfound interest in the eating plan makes sense.
If any brand would be bringing the ice cream category to a weight loss diet, it’ s Halo Top. After all, it built its brand around creating good tasting, low-calorie, high-protein and low-sugar ice cream that is often perceived as healthier than traditional varieties of the treat. That combination led Halo Top’ s sales to skyrocket 2,500% between 2016 and 2017, when it became the No. 1 selling pint of ice cream in the United States. It also inspired copycat pints of ice cream from other brands, including Breyers, Ben & Jerry’ s and Unilever’ s launch of Culture Republick.
Halo Top isn’ t the only sweet treat being reimagined to fit in the keto diet. Duncan Hines, the Conagra-owned baking brand, recently launched keto-friendly cake mixes. Considering that the keto diet is marked by eating high nutrient, low carb whole foods — like green vegetables, meat, nuts and cheese — it’ s apparent CPG manufacturers feel people on the regimen still want to indulge.
This is the first big launch from Halo Top since it was bought by Blue Bunny maker Wells Enterprises last year. Wells, which is the largest privately held ice cream maker in the United States, picked a splashy first line extension for Halo Top. But if the brand’ s history is any indication of its performance, expect to see many keto-friendly ice cream pints crowding the freezer section next year.

With yogurt and milk dominating the oat craze, it’ s only fitting that beer should tap into the trend too.
DuClaw Brewing is rolling out Oatshake Double IPA and The PastryArchy Oat Milk imperial stout. Both are made with oat milk instead of the lactose traditionally used in beers for creaminess. The Baltimore-based brewer said it plans to distribute the drinks to the 19 states where its product is distributed. A 4-pack of 16-ounce cans is expected to sell between $ 11.99 and $ 13.99.
“ Putting oat milk into beer sounds new, but it’ s really just extracting the liquid from soaking oats in water, ” Chris Wood, DuClaw’ s director of brewery operations, said in a statement. “ Those are two ingredients we use frequently. ''
A company spokeswoman said in an email creating the beer “ was a journey ” because DuClaw couldn’ t purchase oat milk in large volumes. In addition to making the brew, they needed to figure out how to make enough oat milk in-house at the brewery, which included scraping concrete-like oats out of brewing tanks.
The popularity of oats has grown as consumers look to eat healthier and are attracted to the ingredient's halo. In the last year, Chobani introduced oat-based yogurts and oat milk for coffee shops. And Nestlé's Nesquik recently introduced a new beverage brand called GoodNes, which debuts with the release of Chocolate Oat Milk this month. And Endangered Species Chocolate has a new chocolate bar line using oat milk rather than dairy.
For beer companies such as DuClaw, experimenting with oat milk allows them to try something new that differentiates themselves from the other more than 7,300 craft beer companies throughout the country. At the same time, it allows the brewer to harness an ingredient increasingly popular with U.S. consumers.
With so many brewers around, it's no longer enough just to be a maker of craft beers. While tapping into a trendy ingredient like oat milk is not a surefire way to guarantee success, it gets consumers talking — and that’ s a marketing win for any business.

At this rate, it seems like there will be a dairy-free alternative for everything.
Danone-owned brand Silk is launching the first plant-based alternative to dairy-based heavy whipping cream. The heavy cream — a blend of coconut and sunflower oils, faba bean protein, and sunflower lecithin — is now available in grocery stores nationwide, according to a release.
The plant-based product is keto-friendly, gluten-free and Non-GMO Project Verified. According to the release, Silk Heavy Whipping Cream Alternative can be used in various recipes for desserts, sauces, soups and more.
David Robinson, senior brand manager for Silk, said in a statement that the company is introducing this product because they saw an opportunity for it in the market and wanted to “ provide an easy swap for those looking to incorporate more dairy-free options into their diet. ”
More people are looking to eat and drink less animal-based products. U.S. sales of plant-based foods grew 11% last year, bringing the total plant-based market value to $ 4.5 billion, according to figures released by The Good Food Institute and the Plant Based Foods Association, and that growth is expected to continue.
Dairy products have seen more innovation in the plant-based category in recent years as traditional products from cows have struggled. In an Innova Market Insights report on top trends for 2020, the group predicted the plant-based dairy sector will diversify as consumer interest increases.
To accommodate that diversity, Silk already debuted dairy-free half and half coffee creamer made with oat and coconut milk, so it could have consumers who are ready for another alternative cream.
But other companies are also launching plant-based cream products. In 2018, Conagra Brands’ Reddi-Wip released a coconut- and almond-based vegan whipped cream. And last year, Trader Joe’ s relaunched its vegan Coconut Whipped Topping under the brand name Sweet Rose.
While those other products are already created to top a coffee, pie or ice cream sundae — unlike this launch of an ingredient waiting to be turned into dessert, used to make a complex sauce or turned into biscuits — it's likely Silk will have direct competition soon. That will continue as more dairy alternatives take a bigger piece of the market.

774,Trump thanks China's Xi Jinping for handling of coronavirus,"President Donald Trump thanked Chinese President Xi Jinping for his country's handling of the coronavirus, shortly after American health officials confirmed a second case of the flu-like virus in the United States.
`` China has been working very hard to contain the Coronavirus, '' Trump wrote in a post on Twitter. `` The United States greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency. It will all work out well. In particular, on behalf of the American People, I want to thank President Xi! ''
Experts have said that the Chinese response to the outbreak of coronavirus, which was first diagnosed late last month, has been more robust and transparent than the country's handling of the SARS outbreak, which it sought to conceal in late 2002 and 2003.
The death toll escalated to dozens on Friday, authorities in the country said, with more than 800 known cases on the mainland. As part of the response, authorities were rushing on Friday to complete construction of a new 1,000-bed hospital in Wuhan, the city where the outbreak began.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported the first instance of the virus in the United States earlier this week. There are 63 cases being monitored across 22 states, according to the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases.
The second patient diagnosed with the virus is a woman in her 60s who recently returned from Wuhan, health officials said Friday. The first U.S. patient, whose diagnosis was confirmed on Tuesday, had also recently traveled to Wuhan.
In an interview on Wednesday, Trump said that he believed the virus was under control. He also said he had confidence in the Chinese government to be transparent.
`` We have it under control. It's going to be just fine, '' Trump told CNBC's Joe Kernen.
The major stock market indexes declined on Friday amid fears that the virus could damage global growth.",business
777,"Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China","BackgroundA recent cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus ( 2019-nCoV). We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.MethodsAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan. We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.

A recent cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus ( 2019-nCoV). We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.
All patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan. We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing. Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records. Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data. Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit ( ICU) and those who had not.
By Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection. Most of the infected patients were men ( 30 [ 73% ] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases ( 13 [ 32% ]), including diabetes ( eight [ 20% ]), hypertension ( six [ 15% ]), and cardiovascular disease ( six [ 15% ]). Median age was 49·0 years ( IQR 41·0–58·0). 27 ( 66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market. One family cluster was found. Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever ( 40 [ 98% ] of 41 patients), cough ( 31 [ 76% ]), and myalgia or fatigue ( 18 [ 44% ]); less common symptoms were sputum production ( 11 [ 28% ] of 39), headache ( three [ 8% ] of 38), haemoptysis ( two [ 5% ] of 39), and diarrhoea ( one [ 3% ] of 38). Dyspnoea developed in 22 ( 55%) of 40 patients ( median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [ IQR 5·0–13·0 ]). 26 ( 63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia. All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT. Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome ( 12 [ 29% ]), RNAaemia ( six [ 15% ]), acute cardiac injury ( five [ 12% ]) and secondary infection ( four [ 10% ]). 13 ( 32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six ( 15%) died. Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNFα.
The 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality. Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.

Research in contextEvidence before this studyHuman coronaviruses, including hCoV-229E, OC43, NL63, and HKU1, cause mild respiratory diseases. Fatal coronavirus infections that have emerged in the past two decades are severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( SARS-CoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. We searched PubMed and the China National Knowledge Infrastructure database for articles published up to Jan 11, 2020, using the keywords “ novel coronovirus ”, “ 2019 novel coronavirus ”, or “ 2019-nCoV ”. No published work about the human infection caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus ( 2019-nCoV) could be identified.Added value of this studyWe report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics, treatment, and clinical outcomes of 41 laboratory-confirmed cases infected with 2019-nCoV. 27 ( 66%) of 41 patients had a history of direct exposure to the Huanan seafood market. The median age of patients was 49·0 years ( IQR 41·0–58·0), and 13 ( 32%) patients had underlying disease. All patients had pneumonia. A third of patients were admitted to intensive care units, and six died. High concentrations of cytokines were recorded in plasma of critically ill patients infected with 2019-nCoV.Implications of all the available evidence2019-nCoV caused clusters of fatal pneumonia with clinical presentation greatly resembling SARS-CoV. Patients infected with 2019-nCoV might develop acute respiratory distress syndrome, have a high likelihood of admission to intensive care, and might die. The cytokine storm could be associated with disease severity. More efforts should be made to know the whole spectrum and pathophysiology of the new disease.

The cytokine storm could be associated with disease severity. More efforts should be made to know the whole spectrum and pathophysiology of the new disease.
We aim to describe epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics, treatment, and outcomes of patients confirmed to have 2019-nCoV infection, and to compare the clinical features between intensive care unit ( ICU) and non-ICU patients. We hope our study findings will inform the global community of the emergence of this novel coronavirus and its clinical features.
Following the pneumonia cases of unknown cause reported in Wuhan and considering the shared history of exposure to Huanan seafood market across the patients, an epidemiological alert was released by the local health authority on Dec 31, 2019, and the market was shut down on Jan 1, 2020. Meanwhile, 59 suspected cases with fever and dry cough were transferred to a designated hospital starting from Dec 31, 2019. An expert team of physicians, epidemiologists, virologists, and government officials was soon formed after the alert.
Since the cause was unknown at the onset of these emerging infections, the diagnosis of pneumonia of unknown cause in Wuhan was based on clinical characteristics, chest imaging, and the ruling out of common bacterial and viral pathogens that cause pneumonia. Suspected patients were isolated using airborne precautions in the designated hospital, Jin Yin-tan Hospital ( Wuhan, China), and fit-tested N95 masks and airborne precautions for aerosol-generating procedures were taken. This study was approved by the National Health Commission of China and Ethics Commission of Jin Yin-tan Hospital ( KY-2020-01.01). Written informed consent was waived by the Ethics Commission of the designated hospital for emerging infectious diseases.
Local centres for disease control and prevention collected respiratory, blood, and faeces specimens, then shipped them to designated authoritative laboratories to detect the pathogen ( NHC Key Laboratory of Systems Biology of Pathogens and Christophe Mérieux Laboratory, Beijing, China). A novel coronavirus, which was named 2019-nCoV, was isolated then from lower respiratory tract specimen and a diagnostic test for this virus was developed soon after that.14Tan W Zhao X Ma X et al.A novel coronavirus genome identified in a cluster of pneumonia cases — Wuhan, China 2019−2020.http: //weekly.chinacdc.cn/en/article/id/a3907201-f64f-4154-a19e-4253b453d10cDate accessed: January 23, 2020Google Scholar Of 59 suspected cases, 41 patients were confirmed to be infected with 2019-nCoV. The presence of 2019-nCoV in respiratory specimens was detected by next-generation sequencing or real-time RT-PCR methods. The primers and probe target to envelope gene of CoV were used and the sequences were as follows: forward primer 5′-ACTTCTTTTTCTTGCTTTCGTGGT-3′; reverse primer 5′-GCAGCAGTACGCACACAATC-3′; and the probe 5′CY5-CTAGTTACACTAGCCATCCTTACTGC-3′BHQ1. Conditions for the amplifications were 50°C for 15 min, 95°C for 3 min, followed by 45 cycles of 95°C for 15 s and 60°C for 30 s.
Initial investigations included a complete blood count, coagulation profile, and serum biochemical test ( including renal and liver function, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, and electrolytes). Respiratory specimens, including nasal and pharyngeal swabs, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, sputum, or bronchial aspirates were tested for common viruses, including influenza, avian influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV using real-time RT-PCR assays approved by the China Food and Drug Administration. Routine bacterial and fungal examinations were also performed.
Given the emergence of the 2019-nCoV pneumonia cases during the influenza season, antibiotics ( orally and intravenously) and oseltamivir ( orally 75 mg twice daily) were empirically administered. Corticosteroid therapy ( methylprednisolone 40–120 mg per day) was given as a combined regimen if severe community-acquired pneumonia was diagnosed by physicians at the designated hospital. Oxygen support ( eg, nasal cannula and invasive mechanical ventilation) was administered to patients according to the severity of hypoxaemia. Repeated tests for 2019-nCoV were done in patients confirmed to have 2019-nCoV infection to show viral clearance before hospital discharge or discontinuation of isolation.
We reviewed clinical charts, nursing records, laboratory findings, and chest x-rays for all patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection who were reported by the local health authority. The admission data of these patients was from Dec 16, 2019, to Jan 2, 2020. Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and outcomes data were obtained with standardised data collection forms ( modified case record form for severe acute respiratory infection clinical characterisation shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium) from electronic medical records. Two researchers also independently reviewed the data collection forms to double check the data collected. To ascertain the epidemiological and symptom data, which were not available from electronic medical records, the researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.
To characterise the effect of coronavirus on the production of cytokines or chemokines in the acute phase of the illness, plasma cytokines and chemokines ( IL1B, IL1RA, IL2, IL4, IL5, IL6, IL7, IL8 ( also known as CXCL8), IL9, IL10, IL12p70, IL13, IL15, IL17A, Eotaxin ( also known as CCL11), basic FGF2, GCSF ( CSF3), GMCSF ( CSF2), IFNγ, IP10 ( CXCL10), MCP1 ( CCL2), MIP1A ( CCL3), MIP1B ( CCL4), PDGFB, RANTES ( CCL5), TNFα, and VEGFA were measured using Human Cytokine Standard 27-Plex Assays panel and the Bio-Plex 200 system ( Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) for all patients according to the manufacturer's instructions. The plasma samples from four healthy adults were used as controls for cross-comparison. The median time from being transferred to a designated hospital to the blood sample collection was 4 days ( IQR 2–5).
Each 80 μL plasma sample from the patients and contacts was added into 240 μL of Trizol LS ( 10296028; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Carlsbad, CA, USA) in the Biosafety Level 3 laboratory. Total RNA was extracted by Direct-zol RNA Miniprep kit ( R2050; Zymo research, Irvine, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions and 50 μL elution was obtained for each sample. 5 μL RNA was used for real-time RT-PCR, which targeted the NP gene using AgPath-ID One-Step RT-PCR Reagent ( AM1005; Thermo Fisher Scientific). The final reaction mix concentration of the primers was 500 nM and probe was 200 nM. Real-time RT-PCR was performed using the following conditions: 50°C for 15 min and 95°C for 3 min, 50 cycles of amplification at 95°C for 10 s and 60°C for 45 s. Since we did not perform tests for detecting infectious virus in blood, we avoided the term viraemia and used RNAaemia instead. RNAaemia was defined as a positive result for real-time RT-PCR in the plasma sample.
Acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS) and shock were defined according to the interim guidance of WHO for novel coronavirus.9WHONovel coronavirus – China.http: //www.who.int/csr/don/12-january-2020-novel-coronavirus-china/en/Date: Jan 12, 2020Date accessed: January 19, 2020Google Scholar Hypoxaemia was defined as arterial oxygen tension ( PaO2) over inspiratory oxygen fraction ( FIO2) of less than 300 mm Hg.15Sanz F Gimeno C Lloret T et al.Relationship between the presence of hypoxemia and the inflammatory response measured by C-reactive protein in bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia.Eur Respir J. 2011; 38: 2492Google Scholar Acute kidney injury was identified and classified on the basis of the highest serum creatinine level or urine output criteria according to the kidney disease improving global outcomes classification.16Kidney disease: improving global outcomes ( KDIGO) acute kidney injury work groupKDIGO clinical practice guideline for acute kidney injury.https: //kdigo.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/KDIGO-2012-AKI-Guideline-English.pdfDate: March, 2012Date accessed: January 23, 2020Google Scholar Secondary infection was diagnosed if the patients had clinical symptoms or signs of nosocomial pneumonia or bacteraemia, and was combined with a positive culture of a new pathogen from a lower respiratory tract specimen ( including the sputum, transtracheal aspirates, or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, or from blood samples taken ≥48 h after admission).17Garner JS Jarvis WR Emori TG Horan TC Hughes JM CDC definitions for nosocomial infections, 1988.Am J Infect Control. 1988; 16: 128-140Summary Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus ( 4934) Google Scholar Cardiac injury followed the definition used in our previous study in H7N9 patients.18Gao C Wang Y Gu X et al.Association between cardiac injury and mortality in hospitalized patients infected with avian influenza A ( H7N9) virus.Crit Care Med. 2020; ( published online Jan 20) DOI:10.1097/CCM.0000000000004207Crossref Scopus ( 42) Google Scholar In brief, cardiac injury was diagnosed if serum levels of cardiac biomarkers ( eg, troponin I) were above the 99th percentile upper reference limit, or new abnormalities were shown in electrocardiography and echocardiography.
Continuous variables were expressed as median ( IQR) and compared with the Mann-Whitney U test; categorical variables were expressed as number (%) and compared by χ2 test or Fisher's exact test between ICU care and no ICU care groups. Boxplots were drawn to describe plasma cytokine and chemokine concentrations.
A two-sided α of less than 0·05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses were done using the SAS software, version 9.4, unless otherwise indicated.

By Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients were identified as laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection in Wuhan. 20 [ 49% ]) of the 2019-nCoV-infected patients were aged 25–49 years, and 14 ( 34%) were aged 50–64 years ( figure 1A). The median age of the patients was 49·0 years ( IQR 41·0–58·0; table 1). In our cohort of the first 41 patients as of Jan 2, no children or adolescents were infected. Of the 41 patients, 13 ( 32%) were admitted to the ICU because they required high-flow nasal cannula or higher-level oxygen support measures to correct hypoxaemia. Most of the infected patients were men ( 30 [ 73% ]); less than half had underlying diseases ( 13 [ 32% ]), including diabetes ( eight [ 20% ]), hypertension ( six [ 15% ]), and cardiovascular disease ( six [ 15% ]).Figure 1Date of illness onset and age distribution of patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infectionShow full caption ( A) Number of hospital admissions by age group.

27 ( 66%) patients had direct exposure to Huanan seafood market ( figure 1B). Market exposure was similar between the patients with ICU care ( nine [ 69% ]) and those with non-ICU care ( 18 [ 64% ]). The symptom onset date of the first patient identified was Dec 1, 2019. None of his family members developed fever or any respiratory symptoms. No epidemiological link was found between the first patient and later cases. The first fatal case, who had continuous exposure to the market, was admitted to hospital because of a 7-day history of fever, cough, and dyspnoea. 5 days after illness onset, his wife, a 53-year-old woman who had no known history of exposure to the market, also presented with pneumonia and was hospitalised in the isolation ward.
The most common symptoms at onset of illness were fever ( 40 [ 98% ] of 41 patients), cough ( 31 [ 76% ]), and myalgia or fatigue ( 18 [ 44% ]); less common symptoms were sputum production ( 11 [ 28% ] of 39), headache ( three [ 8% ] of 38), haemoptysis ( two [ 5% ] of 39), and diarrhoea ( one [ 3% ] of 38; table 1). More than half of patients ( 22 [ 55% ] of 40) developed dyspnoea. The median duration from illness onset to dyspnoea was 8·0 days ( IQR 5·0–13·0). The median time from onset of symptoms to first hospital admission was 7·0 days ( 4·0–8·0), to shortness of breath was 8·0 days ( 5·0–13·0), to ARDS was 9·0 days ( 8·0–14·0), to mechanical ventilation was 10·5 days ( 7·0–14·0), and to ICU admission was 10·5 days ( 8·0–17·0; figure 2).Figure 2Timeline of 2019-nCoV cases after onset of illnessView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download ( PPT)
The blood counts of patients on admission showed leucopenia ( white blood cell count less than 4 × 109/L; ten [ 25% ] of 40 patients) and lymphopenia ( lymphocyte count < 1·0 × 109/L; 26 [ 63% ] patients; table 2). Prothrombin time and D-dimer level on admission were higher in ICU patients ( median prothrombin time 12·2 s [ IQR 11·2–13·4 ]; median D-dimer level 2·4 mg/L [ 0·6–14·4 ]) than non-ICU patients ( median prothrombin time 10·7 s [ 9·8–12·1 ], p=0·012; median D-dimer level 0·5 mg/L [ 0·3–0·8 ], p=0·0042). Levels of aspartate aminotransferase were increased in 15 ( 37%) of 41 patients, including eight ( 62%) of 13 ICU patients and seven ( 25%) of 28 non-ICU patients. Hypersensitive troponin I ( hs-cTnI) was increased substantially in five patients, in whom the diagnosis of virus-related cardiac injury was made.Table 2Laboratory findings of patients infected with 2019-nCoV on admission to hospitalAll patients ( n=41) ICU care ( n=13) No ICU care ( n=28) p valueWhite blood cell count, × 109/L6·2 ( 4·1–10·5) 11·3 ( 5·8–12·1) 5·7 ( 3·1–7·6) 0·011 < 410/40 ( 25%) 1/13 ( 8%) 9/27 ( 33%) 0·0414–1018/40 ( 45%) 5/13 ( 38%) 13/27 ( 48%).. > 1012/40 ( 30%) 7/13 ( 54%) 5/27 ( 19%)..

Most patients had normal serum levels of procalcitonin on admission ( procalcitonin < 0·1 ng/mL; 27 [ 69% ] patients; table 2). Four ICU patients developed secondary infections. Three of the four patients with secondary infection had procalcitonin greater than 0·5 ng/mL ( 0·69 ng/mL, 1·46 ng/mL, and 6·48 ng/mL).
On admission, abnormalities in chest CT images were detected among all patients. Of the 41 patients, 40 ( 98%) had bilateral involvement ( table 2). The typical findings of chest CT images of ICU patients on admission were bilateral multiple lobular and subsegmental areas of consolidation ( figure 3A). The representative chest CT findings of non-ICU patients showed bilateral ground-glass opacity and subsegmental areas of consolidation ( figure 3B). Later chest CT images showed bilateral ground-glass opacity, whereas the consolidation had been resolved ( figure 3C).Figure 3Chest CT imagesShow full caption ( A) Transverse chest CT images from a 40-year-old man showing bilateral multiple lobular and subsegmental areas of consolidation on day 15 after symptom onset.

Initial plasma IL1B, IL1RA, IL7, IL8, IL9, IL10, basic FGF, GCSF, GMCSF, IFNγ, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, MIP1B, PDGF, TNFα, and VEGF concentrations were higher in both ICU patients and non-ICU patients than in healthy adults ( appendix pp 6–7). Plasma levels of IL5, IL12p70, IL15, Eotaxin, and RANTES were similar between healthy adults and patients infected with 2019-nCoV. Further comparison between ICU and non-ICU patients showed that plasma concentrations of IL2, IL7, IL10, GCSF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNFα were higher in ICU patients than non-ICU patients.
All patients had pneumonia. Common complications included ARDS ( 12 [ 29% ] of 41 patients), followed by RNAaemia ( six [ 15% ] patients), acute cardiac injury ( five [ 12% ] patients), and secondary infection ( four [ 10% ] patients; table 3). Invasive mechanical ventilation was required in four ( 10%) patients, with two of them ( 5%) had refractory hypoxaemia and received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation as salvage therapy. All patients were administered with empirical antibiotic treatment, and 38 ( 93%) patients received antiviral therapy ( oseltamivir). Additionally, nine ( 22%) patients were given systematic corticosteroids. A comparison of clinical features between patients who received and did not receive systematic corticosteroids is in the appendix ( pp 1–5).Table 3Treatments and outcomes of patients infected with 2019-nCoVAll patients ( n=41) ICU care ( n=13) No ICU care ( n=28) p valueDuration from illness onset to first admission7·0 ( 4·0–8·0) 7·0 ( 4·0–8·0) 7·0 ( 4·0–8·5) 0·87ComplicationsAcute respiratory distress syndrome12 ( 29%) 11 ( 85%) 1 ( 4%) < 0·0001RNAaemia6 ( 15%) 2 ( 15%) 4 ( 14%) 0·93Cycle threshold of RNAaemia35·1 ( 34·7–35·1) 35·1 ( 35·1–35·1) 34·8 ( 34·1–35·4) 0·35Acute cardiac injury * Defined as blood levels of hypersensitive troponin I above the 99th percentile upper reference limit ( > 28 pg/mL) or new abnormalities shown on electrocardiography and echocardiography.5 ( 12%) 4 ( 31%) 1 ( 4%) 0·017Acute kidney injury3 ( 7%) 3 ( 23%) 00·027Secondary infection4 ( 10%) 4 ( 31%) 00·0014Shock3 ( 7%) 3 ( 23%) 00·027TreatmentAntiviral therapy38 ( 93%) 12 ( 92%) 26 ( 93%) 0·46Antibiotic therapy41 ( 100%) 13 ( 100%) 28 ( 100%) NAUse of corticosteroid9 ( 22%) 6 ( 46%) 3 ( 11%) 0·013Continuous renal replacement therapy3 ( 7%) 3 ( 23%) 00·027Oxygen support...... < 0·0001Nasal cannula27 ( 66%) 1 ( 8%) 26 ( 93%)..

As of Jan 22, 2020, 28 ( 68%) of 41 patients have been discharged and six ( 15%) patients have died. Fitness for discharge was based on abatement of fever for at least 10 days, with improvement of chest radiographic evidence and viral clearance in respiratory samples from upper respiratory tract.
We report here a cohort of 41 patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection. Patients had serious, sometimes fatal, pneumonia and were admitted to the designated hospital in Wuhan, China, by Jan 2, 2020. Clinical presentations greatly resemble SARS-CoV. Patients with severe illness developed ARDS and required ICU admission and oxygen therapy. The time between hospital admission and ARDS was as short as 2 days. At this stage, the mortality rate is high for 2019-nCoV, because six ( 15%) of 41 patients in this cohort died.
The number of deaths is rising quickly. As of Jan 24, 2020, 835 laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infections were reported in China, with 25 fatal cases. Reports have been released of exported cases in many provinces in China, and in other countries; some health-care workers have also been infected in Wuhan. Taken together, evidence so far indicates human transmission for 2019-nCoV. We are concerned that 2019-nCoV could have acquired the ability for efficient human transmission.19Perlman S Netland J Coronaviruses post-SARS: update on replication and pathogenesis.Nat Rev Microbiol. 2009; 7: 439-450Crossref PubMed Scopus ( 825) Google Scholar Airborne precautions, such as a fit-tested N95 respirator, and other personal protective equipment are strongly recommended. To prevent further spread of the disease in health-care settings that are caring for patients infected with 2019-nCoV, onset of fever and respiratory symptoms should be closely monitored among health-care workers. Testing of respiratory specimens should be done immediately once a diagnosis is suspected. Serum antibodies should be tested among health-care workers before and after their exposure to 2019-nCoV for identification of asymptomatic infections.
Similarities of clinical features between 2019-nCoV and previous betacoronavirus infections have been noted. In this cohort, most patients presented with fever, dry cough, dyspnoea, and bilateral ground-glass opacities on chest CT scans. These features of 2019-nCoV infection bear some resemblance to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections.20Lee N Hui D Wu A et al.A major outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in Hong Kong.N Engl J Med. 2003; 348: 1986-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus ( 1693) Google Scholar, 21Assiri A Al-Tawfiq JA Al-Rabeeah AA et al.Epidemiological, demographic, and clinical characteristics of 47 cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus disease from Saudi Arabia: a descriptive study.Lancet Infect Dis. 2013; 13: 752-761Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus ( 839) Google Scholar However, few patients with 2019-nCoV infection had prominent upper respiratory tract signs and symptoms ( eg, rhinorrhoea, sneezing, or sore throat), indicating that the target cells might be located in the lower airway. Furthermore, 2019-nCoV patients rarely developed intestinal signs and symptoms ( eg, diarrhoea), whereas about 20–25% of patients with MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV infection had diarrhoea.21Assiri A Al-Tawfiq JA Al-Rabeeah AA et al.Epidemiological, demographic, and clinical characteristics of 47 cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus disease from Saudi Arabia: a descriptive study.Lancet Infect Dis. 2013; 13: 752-761Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus ( 839) Google Scholar Faecal and urine samples should be tested to exclude a potential alternative route of transmission that is unknown at this stage.
The pathophysiology of unusually high pathogenicity for SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV has not been completely understood. Early studies have shown that increased amounts of proinflammatory cytokines in serum ( eg, IL1B, IL6, IL12, IFNγ, IP10, and MCP1) were associated with pulmonary inflammation and extensive lung damage in SARS patients.22Wong CK Lam CWK Wu AKL et al.Plasma inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in severe acute respiratory syndrome.Clin Exp Immunol. 2004; 136: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus ( 738) Google Scholar MERS-CoV infection was also reported to induce increased concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines ( IFNγ, TNFα, IL15, and IL17).23Mahallawi WH Khabour OF Zhang Q Makhdoum HM Suliman BA MERS-CoV infection in humans is associated with a pro-inflammatory Th1 and Th17 cytokine profile.Cytokine. 2018; 104: 8-13Crossref PubMed Scopus ( 304) Google Scholar We noted that patients infected with 2019-nCoV also had high amounts of IL1B, IFNγ, IP10, and MCP1, probably leading to activated T-helper-1 ( Th1) cell responses. Moreover, patients requiring ICU admission had higher concentrations of GCSF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNFα than did those not requiring ICU admission, suggesting that the cytokine storm was associated with disease severity. However, 2019-nCoV infection also initiated increased secretion of T-helper-2 ( Th2) cytokines ( eg, IL4 and IL10) that suppress inflammation, which differs from SARS-CoV infection.22Wong CK Lam CWK Wu AKL et al.Plasma inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in severe acute respiratory syndrome.Clin Exp Immunol. 2004; 136: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus ( 738) Google Scholar Further studies are necessary to characterise the Th1 and Th2 responses in 2019-nCoV infection and to elucidate the pathogenesis. Autopsy or biopsy studies would be the key to understand the disease.

However, current evidence in patients with SARS and MERS suggests that receiving corticosteroids did not have an effect on mortality, but rather delayed viral clearance.27Stockman LJ Bellamy R Garner P SARS: systematic review of treatment effects.PLoS Med. 2006; 3: e343Crossref PubMed Scopus ( 707) Google Scholar, 28Lansbury L Rodrigo C Leonardi-Bee J Nguyen-Van-Tam J Lim WS Corticosteroids as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of influenza.Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2019; 2: CD010406PubMed Google Scholar, 29Arabi YM Mandourah Y Al-Hameed F et al.Corticosteroid therapy for critically ill patients with Middle East respiratory syndrome.Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 2018; 197: 757-767Crossref PubMed Scopus ( 560) Google Scholar Therefore, corticosteroids should not be routinely given systemically, according to WHO interim guidance.30WHOClinical management of severe acute respiratory infection when novel coronavirus ( nCoV) infection is suspected.https: //www.who.int/internal-publications-detail/clinical-management-of-severe-acute-respiratory-infection-when-novel-coronavirus- ( ncov) -infection-is-suspectedDate: Jan 11, 2020Date accessed: January 19, 2020Google Scholar Among our cohort of 41 laboratory-confirmed patients with 2019-nCoV infection, corticosteroids were given to very few non-ICU cases, and low-to-moderate dose of corticosteroids were given to less than half of severely ill patients with ARDS. Further evidence is urgently needed to assess whether systematic corticosteroid treatment is beneficial or harmful for patients infected with 2019-nCoV.
No antiviral treatment for coronavirus infection has been proven to be effective. In a historical control study,31Chu CM Role of lopinavir/ritonavir in the treatment of SARS: initial virological and clinical findings.Thorax. 2004; 59: 252-256Crossref PubMed Scopus ( 972) Google Scholar the combination of lopinavir and ritonavir among SARS-CoV patients was associated with substantial clinical benefit ( fewer adverse clinical outcomes). Arabi and colleagues initiated a placebo-controlled trial of interferon beta-1b, lopinavir, and ritonavir among patients with MERS infection in Saudi Arabia.32Arabi YM Alothman A Balkhy HH et al.Treatment of Middle East respiratory syndrome with a combination of lopinavir-ritonavir and interferon-β1b ( MIRACLE trial): study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.Trials. 2018; 19: 81Crossref PubMed Scopus ( 169) Google Scholar Preclinical evidence showed the potent efficacy of remdesivir ( a broad-spectrum antiviral nucleotide prodrug) to treat MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV infections.33Sheahan TP Sims AC Graham RL et al.Broad-spectrum antiviral GS-5734 inhibits both epidemic and zoonotic coronaviruses.Sci Transl Med. 2017; 9eaal3653Crossref PubMed Scopus ( 758) Google Scholar, 34Sheahan TP Sims AC Leist SR et al.Comparative therapeutic efficacy of remdesivir and combination lopinavir, ritonavir, and interferon beta against MERS-CoV.Nat Commun. 2020; 11: 222Crossref PubMed Scopus ( 859) Google Scholar As 2019-nCoV is an emerging virus, an effective treatment has not been developed for disease resulting from this virus. Since the combination of lopinavir and ritonavir was already available in the designated hospital, a randomised controlled trial has been initiated quickly to assess the efficacy and safety of combined use of lopinavir and ritonavir in patients hospitalised with 2019-nCoV infection.
Our study has some limitations. First, for most of the 41 patients, the diagnosis was confirmed with lower respiratory tract specimens and no paired nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained to investigate the difference in the viral RNA detection rate between upper and lower respiratory tract specimens. Serological detection was not done to look for 2019-nCoV antibody rises in 18 patients with undetectable viral RNA. Second, with the limited number of cases, it is difficult to assess host risk factors for disease severity and mortality with multivariable-adjusted methods. This is a modest-sized case series of patients admitted to hospital; collection of standardised data for a larger cohort would help to further define the clinical presentation, natural history, and risk factors. Further studies in outpatient, primary care, or community settings are needed to get a full picture of the spectrum of clinical severity. At the same time, finding of statistical tests and p values should be interpreted with caution, and non-significant p values do not necessarily rule out difference between ICU and non-ICU patients. Third, since the causative pathogen has just been identified, kinetics of viral load and antibody titres were not available. Finally, the potential exposure bias in our study might account for why no paediatric or adolescent patients were reported in this cohort. More effort should be made to answer these questions in future studies.
Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were believed to originate in bats, and these infections were transmitted directly to humans from market civets and dromedary camels, respectively.35Cui J Li F Shi Z-L Origin and evolution of pathogenic coronaviruses.Nat Rev Microbiol. 2019; 17: 181-192Crossref PubMed Scopus ( 1761) Google Scholar Extensive research on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV has driven the discovery of many SARS-like and MERS-like coronaviruses in bats.

Reliable quick pathogen tests and feasible differential diagnosis based on clinical description are crucial for clinicians in their first contact with suspected patients. Because of the pandemic potential of 2019-nCoV, careful surveillance is essential to monitor its future host adaption, viral evolution, infectivity, transmissibility, and pathogenicity.

Data sharing and outbreaks: best practice exemplifiedThe current outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus ( 2019-nCoV) is yet another example of the importance of infections at the animal–human interface, and the concerns that arise from the emergence of a newly identified organism as it spreads through human populations and across national and international borders. Full-Text PDF A novel coronavirus outbreak of global health concernIn December, 2019, Wuhan, Hubei province, China, became the centre of an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown cause, which raised intense attention not only within China but internationally. Chinese health authorities did an immediate investigation to characterise and control the disease, including isolation of people suspected to have the disease, close monitoring of contacts, epidemiological and clinical data collection from patients, and development of diagnostic and treatment procedures. By Jan 7, 2020, Chinese scientists had isolated a novel coronavirus ( CoV) from patients in Wuhan. Full-Text PDF Full spectrum of COVID-19 severity still being depictedChaolin Huang and colleagues1 first reported the clinical features of patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 ( SARS-CoV-2; previously known as 2019-nCoV), which emerged in Wuhan, China. Their study will contribute to the diagnosis and treatment of 2019 novel coronavirus disease ( COVID-19). Meanwhile, the conclusions have caused a certain degree of social panic.

This outbreak was confirmed to be caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 ( SARS-CoV-2), belonging to the same family of viruses responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome ( MERS).1 The SARS epidemic in 2003 was controlled through numerous measures in China. One effective strategy was the establishment of fever clinics for triaging patients. Based on our first-hand experience in dealing with the present outbreak in Wuhan, we have established the following clinical strategies in adult fever clinics ( figure).

778,How much longer will we trust Google’ s search results?,"Happy Friday to you! I have been reflecting a bit on the controversy du jour: Google’ s redesigned search results. Google is trying to foreground sourcing and URLs, but in the process it made its results look more like ads, or vice versa. Bottom line: Google’ s ads just look like search results now.
I’ m thinking about it because I have to admit that I don’ t personally hate the new favicon -plus-URL structure. But I think that might be because I am not a normal consumer of web content. I’ ve been on the web since the late ‘ 90s and I parse information out of URLs kind of without thinking about it. ( In fact, the relative decline of valuable information getting encoded into the URL is a thing that makes me sad.)
I admit that I am not a normal user. I set up custom Chrome searches and export them to my other browsers. I know what SERP means and the term kind of slips out in regular conversation sometimes. I have opinions about AMP and its URL and caching structure. I’ m a weirdo.
As that weirdo, Google’ s design makes perfect sense and it’ s possible it might do the same for regular folk. The new layout for search result is ugly at first glance — but then Google was always ugly until relatively recently. I very quickly learned to unconsciously take in the information from the top favicon and URL-esque info without it really distracting me.

... Which is basically the problem. Google’ s using that same design language to identify its ads instead of much more obvious, visually distinct methods. It’ s consistent, I guess, but it also feels deceptive.
Recode’ s Peter Kafka recently interviewed Buzzfeed CEO Jonah Peretti, and Peretti said something really insightful: what if Google’ s ads really aren’ t that good? What if Google is just taking credit for clicks on ads just because people would have been searching for that stuff anyway? I’ ve been thinking about it all day: what if Google ads actually aren’ t that effective and the only reason they make so much is billions of people use Google?
The pressure to make them more effective would be fairly strong, then, wouldn’ t it? And it would get increasingly hard to resist that pressure over time.
I am old enough to remember using the search engines before Google. I didn’ t know how bad their search technology was compared to what was to come, but I did have to bounce between several of them to find what I wanted. Knowing what was a good search for WebCrawler and what was good for Yahoo was one of my Power User Of The Internet skills.
So when Google hit, I didn’ t realize how powerful and good the PageRank technology was right away. What I noticed right away is that I could trust the search results to be “ organic ” instead of paid and that there were no dark patterns tricking me into clicking on an ad.
One of the reasons Google won search in the first place with old people like me was that in addition to its superior technology, it drew a harder line against allowing paid advertisements into its search results than its competitors.
With other search engines, there was the problem of “ paid inclusion, ” which is the rare business practice that does exactly what the phrase means. You never really knew if what you were seeing was the result of a web-crawling bot or a business deal.
This new ad layout doesn’ t cross that line, but it’ s definitely problematic and it definitely reduces my trust in Google’ s results. It’ s not so much paid inclusion as paid occlusion.
Today, I still trust Google to not allow business dealings to affect the rankings of its organic results, but how much does that matter if most people can’ t visually tell the difference at first glance? And how much does that matter when certain sections of Google, like hotels and flights, do use paid inclusion? And how much does that matter when business dealings very likely do affect the outcome of what you get when you use the next generation of search, the Google Assistant?
And most of all: if Google is willing to visually muddle ads, how long until its users lose trust in the algorithm itself? With this change, Google is becoming what it once sought to overcome: AltaVista.

└ I trained with Tonal, the ‘ Peloton for weightlifting’
Excellent review from Natt Garun.
Tonal is unique in this field for its focus on weight training instead of cardio. Think of the machine like a slimmer, low-profile Bowflex that mounts flush against the wall rather than taking up an entire corner of your room. With arms that can be adjusted and folded away, it’ s also a bit less likely to end up as an expensive coat rack.

Every year Google does a little online game or coding challenge and every year it’ s solved really quickly. This year Google leaned into that and it seems to have worked.
It’ s a little too early for me to guess what we can expect at I/O this year. Google itself often doesn’ t decide until the last minute. Given everything that’ s happened in the past year, though, I’ l say this: if the entire keynote was just a frank discussion of Google’ s privacy policies and how it intends to be more transparent about what data is has on us and how we can control it, I wouldn’ t complain.

If this turns out to be true, it’ s a huge deal. And it will be a huge problem for Motorola, whose Razr will only have been on the market for five days when Samsung announces the Z Flip on the 11th.
Maybe it’ s just because it’ s a new form factor, but I’ m getting more and more excited about folding phones. For years we’ ve watched phones get bigger and less pocketable and for whatever reason ( the reason is probably that they don’ t sell well), nobody is making high-quality small phones anymore.
Foldables aren’ t exactly that, but they’ re at least heading in the right direction. I will gladly take a little more thickness on the Z axis ( maybe THAT is why it’ s called the Z Flip!) if it means having a big-screen phone that doesn’ t stick out of my pocket.

Okay, one very important thing has changed: Sonos admitted it really screwed up the communication around these changes. It’ s been a mess since the recycling mode first came to light. You can’ t unring a bell, but it’ s at least good to admit you screwed up in the first place.

791,Are you in danger of catching the coronavirus? 5 questions answered,"Editor’ s note: As the Chinese government tries to contain the coronavirus, other cases have occurred across the globe. This raises the question: Will this spread – to me?
Not now, because currently every case of the novel coronavirus is linked to Wuhan.
There are lots of different coronaviruses that group into three types. The common cold can be caused by both alpha and betacoronaviruses.
Coronavirus was never really taken that seriously until 2003, when a coronavirus jumped species – likely from bats to humans via civets – and led to SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome. This species-jumping ability of coronaviruses is being observed again, now in Wuhan at the seafood market. This coronavirus is in the betacoronavirus group. China has now put travel restrictions in place to limit spread from Wuhan.
For the novel coronavirus from Wuhan, there is no vaccine, and we’ re lacking a specific therapy. So it is key to limit spread through quarantine of infected individuals and by tracing of contacts.
This is a coronavirus that has never been seen in humans before. It likely came from bats, and it’ s much more serious than the common cold coronavirus. This is only the third time that we’ ve seen a coronavirus jump species from animals to humans. The concern is that this coronavirus is going to behave like SARS and MERS, or Middle East respiratory syndrome in 2012, both of which were serious.
Many were in older men with pre-existing conditions.
First of all, you need not be concerned about catching this right now. Practice the same precautions that you would to prevent catching a cold. Viruses that cause the common cold are on surfaces of handrails and doorknobs, so wash your hands, use sanitizers and stay home when you are sick.

797,"After virus scare, markets look to Fed rate policy to keep rally going","With stocks coming off their first losing week of the year, investors will be looking for the Federal Reserve to soothe markets by reaffirming its position that interest rates will be low for a long time into the future.
The outbreak of the coronavirus in China in the past week took the steam out of a market that has been repeatedly rallying to new highs since December. The S & P 500 fell just about 1% for the week, amid fears the virus could lead to slower growth not only in China, but across the globe.
Those concerns could continue to spook markets in the coming week, but stocks should be buffeted by the Fed's anticipated commitment to low rates and its current Treasury bill buying program. The Fed meets Tuesday and Wednesday. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is expected to emphasize that the Fed remains on a neutral policy path and that would only change if there was a significant change in the economic outlook.
There are also some major earnings reports, including from Apple, which hit an all-time high Friday morning before closing lower with the broader market. It could have a big impact on sentiment and help influence trading across the technology sector.
Stocks were choppy in the past week, and Treasury yields have been sinking on worries about the new virus. The 10-year yield sunk to a Nov. 1 low of 1.68% and investors drove gold prices higher in a flight-to-safety trade.
`` It's overshadowing everything, and what the market is looking for is that the Chinese are containing it, and the spread is minimal, '' said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. `` The derivative of all of this is what does it do to growth? Traders and investors are hoping the stimulus that has been introduced into the Chinese economy is going to take hold, and this is not going to halt that turnaround. ''
Krosby said the market has been looking for an excuse to pull back. The S & P 500 ended the week at 3,295, off 1%, but it is still up about 2% for the year so far.
`` You could see going into the weekend the 10-year Treasury yield is down, gold is higher, the market is in a text book defensive state, '' said Krosby. `` We had a market that was poised for a bout of profit-taking and this is it. ''
There are more than 135 S & P companies reporting earnings in the week ahead, with a heavy focus on technology, industrials and consumer stocks. Apple reports Tuesday, and Microsoft and Facebook are Wednesday. Boeing and General Electric report Wednesday, while McDonald's releases results Wednesday. On Friday, big oil reports with ExxonMobil and Chevron expected.
Earnings reports so far have been mostly better than expected, with 68.2% of companies beating earnings per share estimates, according to Refinitiv. Earnings are expected to be down about a half percent for the fourth quarter, based on actual reports and estimates of companies yet to report.
`` Coming into any earnings season with stocks at all time highs is fraught with peril, '' said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. `` It's precarious because you have the opportunity for outsized moves if you miss earnings, revenues or guidance. ''
Hogan said companies may be able to give a better indication of the future, now that there's a first phase trade deal between the U.S. and China. He said markets will also be looking for guidance from China and elsewhere on whether the virus appears to be containable or not.
The Federal Reserve is not likely to say much has changed in its outlook, except that it's last three interest rate cuts may have helped the economy and financial conditions.
`` The big news is just talk on the balance sheet. I think that's going to be the key messaging, '' said Jim Caron, portfolio strategist at Morgan Stanley Investment Management. `` I think the data has been okay. There's really nothing new there. The only thing that's really new or interesting is going to be what's going on with the balance sheet. ''
The Fed has been buying about $ 60 billion in Treasury bills each month to expand its balance sheet, ending a program where it was shrinking the balance sheet. The Fed is adding reserves to end a problem in the repo market, which is basically the plumbing of the financial markets where institutions go to get short term cash.
Many traders believe the program is adding liquidity to markets, and therefore driving investors into stocks.
Mark Cabana, head of short rate strategy at BofA Securiteis, said the Fed is not changing its benchmark fed funds target rate, but the fixed income market has been expecting the Fed to make a technical adjustment to another rate. He said the fed funds rate, trading at about 1.55%, has come to the lower end of the Fed's target range of 1.5 to 1.75%.
For that reason it is likely to raise the interest rate on excess reserves by five basis points. `` The intent is to affirm the bottom end of the Fed's target range, `` he said.
Besides the technical move, they `` may be will provide a little more guidance on what it would take to vote rates one way or the other, '' he said.
There's an important data calendar in the coming week, including the first look at the fourth quarter's gross domestic product on Thursday. Personal income and spending data is Friday, and that includes the personal consumption expenditure inflation deflator, watched by the Fed.

804,"Wuhan coronavirus case confirmed in Chicago, the second in the US","
A second case of Wuhan coronavirus in the United States has been identified in Chicago, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday in a press briefing.
The patient is a Chicago resident in her 60s. She is in isolation at a hospital in Chicago, and is in stable condition.
The patient flew from Wuhan to Chicago on January 13. She was not ill while traveling and health authorities do not think she spread the virus during that time. Health authorities say she has had limited close contacts since returning to Chicago; she has not used public transit, attended large gatherings or had extended close contact with anyone outside her home.

The first confirmed US case, announced Tuesday, is a man in his 30s in Washington state. The Snohomish County resident is hospitalized at Providence Regional Medical Center in Everett, Washington, where he is in stable condition. He arrived at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport on January 15, before any health screenings began at US airports.
Sixty-three people from 22 states are under investigation for the virus, health officials said. Eleven of the 63 tested negative for the virus and two, the Chicago patient and the Washington patient, tested positive. The CDC says there are likely to be many more under investigation in the coming days.
The immediate health risk from Wuhan coronavirus to the general American public is considered low at this time, according to the CDC.
`` We understand that some people are worried about this virus and how it may impact Americans. While this situation poses a very serious public health threat, CDC believes that the immediate risk to the US public is low at this time but the situation continues to evolve rapidly, '' said Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases.
According to health authorities, patients infected with the Wuhan coronavirus may have common symptoms such as fever, cough, headache or muscle pain. A subset of patients may have more severe illness including trouble breathing and scans revealing signs of infection in both lungs.
The United States has launched health screenings at several airports. Similar measures are being adopted by airports across Asia, including temperature screening of incoming passengers.
On Thursday, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention raised its travel notice for Wuhan to its highest level, `` warning, '' recommending `` that travelers avoid all nonessential travel to Wuhan, China. ''
Earlier in the week, the agency also activated its Emergency Operations Center -- as it has done with Ebola and vaping-related lung injuries -- to centralize the US response to the outbreak.

every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.
Officials in China have linked the initial infections to a Wuhan seafood and wildlife market, which has been closed since January 1 to prevent further spread of the illness.
Chinese officials are racing to contain the outbreak after it was confirmed the infection can be spread from person to person, raising the possibility of increased transmissions as China enters into the busy Lunar New Year travel period. Wuhan is the largest city in central China and a major transportation hub.

806,The next pandemic will come — here's how to prepare for it,"NEW YORK – As a new coronavirus spreads within China and to other countries, I’ m reminded of my time in Hong Kong during the SARS outbreak of 2003.
Back then, I spent an otherwise beautiful spring wearing masks in public but mostly working from home, as I reported on the disease and the struggle to contain it.
Every day at the same time I checked an official Hong Kong website, which I trusted completely, to see that day’ s new cases. I remember my relief as the number finally trended down. When it was over, it felt as though SARS had been just a shot across the world’ s bow.
For one thing is certain: The next pandemic will come, and it may resemble the Spanish flu of 1918, which infected half a billion people. The questions are when, where and how, and whether we’ ll be ready collectively. I say “ collectively ” because a pandemic, like climate change, doesn’ t respect passports or borders. We don’ t quarantine, cure or save “ America First, ” or “ China First ” or anybody first; we either put humanity first or we all lose.
There are other links between climate change and pandemics ( and, to be clear, the current outbreak is still far from being one). The main connection is that global warming actually creates new disease vectors. As the permafrost thaws in places like Siberia, viruses that have been frozen for millenniums, and against which animals and humans no longer have any resistance, will resurface.
And as desertification and other side effects of warming move the boundaries between habitats, species will come into contact with creatures they’ ve never encountered before. That’ s how viruses start their journey.
What, then, are my lessons from the SARS outbreak? First, we must plan for human nature, both in its perfidy and its heroism. I observed SARS crash into various cultures in totally different ways.
China at first suppressed information about it, fearing economic loss or political turmoil. But that allowed the virus to spread farther and faster for longer than was necessary. And once China did open up on the subject, its people no longer trusted the government’ s information. Rumors circulated and often prevailed over facts, hampering the official response.
Singapore, by contrast, lived up to its reputation for iron discipline with immediate quarantines that I initially considered draconian and illiberal but came reluctantly to respect. Taiwan initially showed the darker side of individualism, as some hospital workers, to protect themselves and their families, shirked their duties. In Hong Kong ( and then Taiwan and other places, too) the opposite happened, as nurses and doctors cared for the victims and valiantly fought the virus.
Nobody who’ s read Albert Camus’ “ The Plague ” or Jose Saramago’ s “ Blindness ” should be surprised that human beings, individually and in crowds, will respond unpredictably to such crises. Some will hoard scarce medicine or food that’ s more urgently needed by others. Some will break quarantines to be with loved ones. Some will do their duty, others won’ t.
The biggest lesson, which China seems to have learned, is that the government must be ruthlessly honest and transparent. The more facts, the better. Hide nothing. It was my trust in that Hong Kong website that eventually made me believe SARS was waning. Once trust between the population and the state breaks down, controlling an outbreak becomes almost impossible.
Another lesson is, thankfully, one we’ ve already learned. Screening and surveillance, which should be used with caution in free societies, becomes necessary in an outbreak and is effective. Even now various airports around the world are digitally observing the body temperatures of passengers arriving from Wuhan, the center of the new outbreak.
Quarantine should be voluntary at first and actively encouraged by employers and government. Whoever can work from home, via Skype and such, should do so, without fearing recrimination. The more people can keep acting on their own volition, the more “ agency ” they believe they have, the calmer and more cooperative they will remain. Once an outbreak goes out of control, of course, quarantines must become mandatory.
But the most profound lesson is that we must cooperate as a species, with a geopolitical approach that seems to have gone out of fashion: multilateralism. We’ ve always been locked in an arms race between the evolution of viruses, bacteria and fungi and our medicines against them. When a new virus appears, it potentially threatens all of us and should be fought by all of us together.
That means a new bug’ s genome, wherever it’ s first collected, should be sequenced and immediately made available, like open-source computer code, to certified researchers everywhere. ( You still need the World Health Organization or some such body to accredit the scientists, lest the genome gets into the hands of terrorists). All labs and scientists should then share their insights with the entire profession.
The bad news is that we can not be sure that humans will rise to global threats such as climate change or pandemics, because we’ re so prone to put what we perceive to be our own interests, or our nations’, first, only to suffer the consequences later.
The good news — and this too is something I learned from SARS — is that every time we do join together to defeat a new threat, we’ re reminded how much we have in common, and fight better the next time.",tech
816,"CEE MARKETS-Currencies gain after euro zone PMIs, Czech bond rally pauses","- Central European currencies gained on Friday, as better than expected PMI data from the euro zone helped restore risk appetite that had taken a hit in recent days from the outbreak of coronavirus in China. IHS Markit flash PMI data for the European Union's economic powerhouse Germany showed its private sector gained momentum in January, while euro zone data showed increased optimism about the year ahead despite business activity remaining weak at the start of the year. `` I think the main reason that CEE currencies gained today in the morning are better-than-expected flash PMIs released in the morning... the risk appetite is back on the market, '' said Santander Bank Polska economist Marcin Sulewski. At 0926 GMT the Hungarian forint was 0.34% firmer against the euro at 335.70, while the Czech crown gained 0.19% against the common currency to be bid at 25.110 and the Polish zloty rose 0.10% to 4.2408. Czech bond yields were mixed after a two-day dive lower as expectations the country's weighting in a key JPMorgan emerging markets bond index will rise at the end of January. One fund manager said JPMorgan had sent a note on Tuesday saying the October 2033 bond would be put in on the last day of January, pushing the country's weighting up by 37 basis points. The 2033 bond yield has dropped around 30 basis points since Tuesday's close. The Czech Republic, whose credit rating is the best in central Europe, has a current weighting in JPMorgan's GBI-EM Global Diversified index for local currency government debt of 3.69%. Benchmark Polish 10-year yields climbed over 4 basis points to 2.30% as investor focus shifted from coronavirus to the flash PMI data. Stocks also got a boost from the risk-on mood, with Poland's WIG 20 index up 0.68% at 0941 GMT and Prague's PX index gaining 0.64% as it contimued to hover around multi-year highs.

835,IHSE Expands the Draco Ultra Series with New KVM Extender Models,"IHSE is expanding the successful Draco ultra series with additional KVM extender models.
These new models enable the transmission of high-definition video signals, including HDMI 1.3, SDI, DVI-I and DVI-D. The Draco ultra range is based on the Lici video codec, developed in cooperation with the Fraunhofer Institute for Integrated Circuits ( IIS), to provide high efficiency in video transmission.
The Draco vario ultra series KVM extenders deliver quality in the transmission of high definition video at 60 frames per second, alongside keyboard, mouse and data signals with very little latency.
The new Draco ultra extender models enable remote operation of a computer from a user workstation, consisting of a keyboard, mouse and video screen, and are capable of handling HDMI 1.3 and 2.0, SDI, DVI-D and DVI-I ( VGA) signals. The SDI extender further converts SDI sources for display on standard computer monitors. Digital audio signals can be de-embedded and output as analogue audio to other devices such as external speakers or headphones.
The DisplayPort 1.2 and HDMI 2.0 models deliver 4K60 video with a colour depth of 10 bits per RGB colour channel and optimal 4:4:4 colour sampling over a single KVM connection.
By synchronising multiple Draco ultra extenders, resolutions like 8K or 5K x 3K can be achieved, which is particularly useful for large displays in showrooms and presentation areas.
Draco ultra KVM extenders are good for users who need reliable, real-time, high-resolution remote computer content with minimal cabling. They are an excellent choice for professional AV applications in rental and staging, highly secure control centres, and virtual reality installations.

845,Airlines Start to Cancel Flights to the Coronavirus-Infected Chinese City of Wuhan,"Low-cost carriers Air Asia and Malindo Air have already temporarily canceled all flights to and from the city.
In an attempt to quell the spread of the new deadly coronavirus, Chinese authorities have put the city of Wuhan on lockdown. Now, international airlines are one by one temporarily canceling all flights to and from the Chinese city.
Malaysian-based low-cost carriers Air Asia and Malindo Air are the first airlines to block their regular flights to and from Wuhan.
Up until today, airports around the world have been screening and checking passengers traveling to and from the coronavirus-infected city of Wuhan. Appropriate quarantine questions have also arisen since the outbreak.
[ Travel Advisory ]: AirAsia Temporarily Cancels All Flights to and from # Wuhan; allows change of travel dates for other cities. ( Updated as of 24 January 2020 at 1300hrs GMT+8) https: //t.co/gK4fZNgar6
China has stopped all citizens of Wuhan from leaving the city. Reports that the city's public transport has stopped operating have been shared, and the airport authorities are not allowing any passengers to leave the city.
Now, some international airlines have taken the matter into their own hands and have canceled flights to and from the city.
BREAKING NEWS: This is not a scene from some apocalyptic horror movie, this is a # coronavirus outbreak in China. The SARS like virus has already spread to four countries and infected more than 1700 people. US airports are monitored. Be on alert, stay safe! pic.twitter.com/PIc7NYvsGO
In a travel advisory, Air Asia has blocked all of its flights between Wuhan and Kota Kinabalu, Bangkok, and Phuket until January 28th.
The airline stated `` AirAsia gives its assurance that the safety and well-being of our guests and Allstars is our top priority. AirAsia is complying with advice and regulations from global and local health authorities, including the World Health Organisation. ''
It continued, `` AirAsia’ s guests who are in Wuhan are advised to abide by announcements made by the government and health authorities, and to contact their respective diplomatic missions or embassies in China for assistance. ''
The airline has extended rerouting options to its passengers who wish to change their flights to and from Wuhan.

Another Malaysian airline, Malindo Air, has joined Air Asia in stopping its routes to and from the Chinese city. The airline operates flights between Kuala Lumpur International Airport and Wuhan two to three times a week.
The airline stated that `` Passengers who hold a valid booking for travel between Jan 23 and Feb 8 may contact our call center at +60378415388 or walk-in to our ticketing office for further assistance. ''
It continued `` We are also monitoring the current situation in Wuhan very closely and will provide the latest developments to our passengers on our website accordingly. ''
It's most likely just a matter of time until other airlines follow suit, but for now, it looks like all parties are closely monitoring the outbreak situation to minimize its spread.

847,Panic and Criticism Spread on Chinese Social Media Over Coronavirus,"HONG KONG — While China’ s state-run media has urged calm and praised the official response to the coronavirus outbreak, a different story is playing out across the country’ s tightly controlled social media networks.
In the digital world, China’ s citizens are expressing panic and frustration. They are overcoming a lack of reporting in the official media by sharing their own videos and information — sometimes inaccurately.
Some are even evading censors, who commonly stifle criticism of the government, to register complaints about how officials have handled the crisis. They have criticized officials for failing to contain the initial outbreak in Wuhan, the capital of the central province of Hubei; for limiting residents to overcrowded facilities in the region; and for not visiting the affected areas.
“ Let’ s not interrupt the leaders while they listen to songs and go abroad for interviews, ” one commenter wrote sarcastically.
Though some barbs have slipped through, the censors are still scrubbing material critical of the government, or information deemed alarming. It has detained at least eight people for spreading what the government has called “ rumors. ”
But residents are still using social networks and messaging platforms to offer on-the-ground accounts of the crisis that are difficult to find elsewhere.
Users have shared experiences of waiting in lines at hospitals for hours, shuttling sick loved ones from hospital to hospital, only to be sent home without being tested for the coronavirus. Some videos, like one taken on an unknown date at Wuhan No. 7 Hospital, have made their way from China’ s closed-off internet onto networks like Twitter.
Several hospitals in affected cities have sent out pleas for donations online, saying they were running short of surgical masks, gloves and other supplies. Some health workers spoke of the challenge of getting to hospitals in cities where public transportation has been shut down and taxi services suspended.
Videos circulating in chat groups and social networks show patients in Wuhan being loaded into an ambulance by workers wearing full-body protective suits outside a primary school, or transported in a plastic tube in Huizhou, a city in the southeastern province of Guangdong. Several videos have emerged of a patient being wheeled through an airport in a sealed-off cage.
The videos often lack crucial identifying information, including when they were filmed, but many have spread rapidly in recent days among Chinese internet users in the absence of more official information. The state-run media has largely played down the crisis, focusing instead on the encouragement of government officials and the heroism of medical workers. Only a few news outlets have reported critically on the handling of the outbreak by the health care system and the government.
Updated June 30, 2020
Common symptoms include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath. Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less common. The C.D.C. has also added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.
Scientists around the country have tried to identify everyday materials that do a good job of filtering microscopic particles. In recent tests, HEPA furnace filters scored high, as did vacuum cleaner bags, fabric similar to flannel pajamas and those of 600-count pillowcases. Other materials tested included layered coffee filters and scarves and bandannas. These scored lower, but still captured a small percentage of particles.
A commentary published this month on the website of the British Journal of Sports Medicine points out that covering your face during exercise “ comes with issues of potential breathing restriction and discomfort ” and requires “ balancing benefits versus possible adverse events. ” Masks do alter exercise, says Cedric X. Bryant, the president and chief science officer of the American Council on Exercise, a nonprofit organization that funds exercise research and certifies fitness professionals. “ In my personal experience, ” he says, “ heart rates are higher at the same relative intensity when you wear a mask. ” Some people also could experience lightheadedness during familiar workouts while masked, says Len Kravitz, a professor of exercise science at the University of New Mexico.
The steroid, dexamethasone, is the first treatment shown to reduce mortality in severely ill patients, according to scientists in Britain. The drug appears to reduce inflammation caused by the immune system, protecting the tissues. In the study, dexamethasone reduced deaths of patients on ventilators by one-third, and deaths of patients on oxygen by one-fifth.
The coronavirus emergency relief package gives many American workers paid leave if they need to take time off because of the virus. It gives qualified workers two weeks of paid sick leave if they are ill, quarantined or seeking diagnosis or preventive care for coronavirus, or if they are caring for sick family members. It gives 12 weeks of paid leave to people caring for children whose schools are closed or whose child care provider is unavailable because of the coronavirus. It is the first time the United States has had widespread federally mandated paid leave, and includes people who don’ t typically get such benefits, like part-time and gig economy workers. But the measure excludes at least half of private-sector workers, including those at the country’ s largest employers, and gives small employers significant leeway to deny leave.
So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited paper published in April suggests that people are most infectious about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms. Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have symptoms was “ very rare, ” but she later walked back that statement.
Touching contaminated objects and then infecting ourselves with the germs is not typically how the virus spreads. But it can happen. A number of studies of flu, rhinovirus, coronavirus and other microbes have shown that respiratory illnesses, including the new coronavirus, can spread by touching contaminated surfaces, particularly in places like day care centers, offices and hospitals. But a long chain of events has to happen for the disease to spread that way. The best way to protect yourself from coronavirus — whether it’ s surface transmission or close human contact — is still social distancing, washing your hands, not touching your face and wearing masks.
A study by European scientists is the first to document a strong statistical link between genetic variations and Covid-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus. Having Type A blood was linked to a 50 percent increase in the likelihood that a patient would need to get oxygen or to go on a ventilator, according to the new study.
The unemployment rate fell to 13.3 percent in May, the Labor Department said on June 5, an unexpected improvement in the nation’ s job market as hiring rebounded faster than economists expected. Economists had forecast the unemployment rate to increase to as much as 20 percent, after it hit 14.7 percent in April, which was the highest since the government began keeping official statistics after World War II. But the unemployment rate dipped instead, with employers adding 2.5 million jobs, after more than 20 million jobs were lost in April.
If air travel is unavoidable, there are some steps you can take to protect yourself. Most important: Wash your hands often, and stop touching your face. If possible, choose a window seat. A study from Emory University found that during flu season, the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window, as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people. Disinfect hard surfaces. When you get to your seat and your hands are clean, use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest, the seatbelt buckle, the remote, screen, seat back pocket and the tray table. If the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather, you can wipe that down, too. ( Using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them.)
If you’ ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have, and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested, how to get tested, and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others.
In the vacuum, misinformation has flourished. One article claimed to cite a health expert as recommending that people counter the virus by rinsing their mouths with salt water, but the expert never said it and the tactic is ineffective. Another widely read but completely false post claimed that setting off fireworks would sterilize germs in the air.
China’ s National Health Commission even went so far as to debunk popular reports saying that drinking a traditional Chinese medicine herb known as indigowoad root, mixed with smoked vinegar, could prevent infection by the coronavirus.
Still, the digital networks have proven useful in conveying the human toll of the virus.
“ Save my life, doctor, I have the fever too, ” a woman in a mask wailed in a widely circulated video, as hospital workers in protective suits walked in and out of what appeared to be a crowded waiting room.

849,Research Underway to Address Threat of Novel Coronavirus That Recently Emerged in China,"Colorized transmission electron micrograph of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome virus particles ( blue) found near the periphery of an infected VERO E6 cell ( yellow).

The new cluster of viral pneumonia cases originating in Wuhan, China, marks the third time in 20 years that a member of the large family of coronaviruses ( CoVs) has jumped from animals to humans and sparked an outbreak. In a new JAMA Viewpoint essay, Anthony S. Fauci, M.D., director of the NIH’ s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases ( NIAID), looks back at two earlier novel CoV outbreaks that initially caused global havoc and describes steps needed to contain the current one.
Dr. Fauci and his co-authors, Hilary D. Marston, M.D., M.P.H., of NIAID, and Catharine I. Paules, M.D., of Penn State University College of Medicine, note that human CoVs historically have been regarded as relatively benign causes of the common cold. In 2002, however, a novel, highly pathogenic CoV emerged in China that caused 8,098 recorded cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS), including 774 deaths, and cost the global economy billions of dollars. Classic public health measures brought the outbreak to an end.
“ The emergence of yet another outbreak of human disease caused by a pathogen from a viral family formerly thought to be relatively benign underscores the perpetual challenge of emerging infectious diseases and the importance of sustained preparedness. ”
Another CoV jumped from animals to humans in 2012 to cause of Middle East respiratory syndrome ( MERS). Unlike SARS-CoV, which has not caused additional human cases since being eliminated within several months of the initial outbreak, MERS-CoV continues to smolder due to sporadic transmission from camels—the virus’ s intermediate host—to people, and limited chains of person-to-person transmission.
The latest CoV to emerge is the 2019 novel coronavirus ( 2019-nCoV), recognized by Chinese authorities in Wuhan on December 31, 2019. It has spread beyond Wuhan to other Chinese cities and to multiple countries, including at least one confirmed case in the United States. The Viewpoint authors write, “ While the trajectory of this outbreak is impossible to predict, effective response requires prompt action from the standpoint of classic public health strategies to the timely development and implementation of effective countermeasures. ”
Current studies at NIAID-funded institutions and by scientists in NIAID laboratories include efforts that build on previous work on SARS- and MERS-CoVs. For example, researchers are developing diagnostic tests to rapidly detect 2019-nCoV infection and exploring the use of broad-spectrum anti-viral drugs to treat 2019-nCoVs, the authors note. NIAID researchers also are adapting approaches used with investigational SARS and MERS vaccines to jumpstart candidate vaccine development for 2019-nCoV. Advances in technology since the SARS outbreak have greatly compressed the vaccine development timeline, the authors write. They indicate that a candidate vaccine for 2019-nCoV could be ready for early-stage human testing in as little as three months as compared to 20 months for early-stage development of an investigational SARS vaccine.
The authors conclude that, “ the emergence of yet another outbreak of human disease caused by a pathogen from a viral family formerly thought to be relatively benign underscores the perpetual challenge of emerging infectious diseases and the importance of sustained preparedness. ”

850,UK tests 14 people for Chinese coronavirus,"14 people in the UK have been tested for the Chinese coronavirus, according to Public Health England ( PHE).
In Scotland, five people have been tested and an incident team has been set up to deal with the health threat. A Welsh resident was also tested for the virus but the results cleared them. In Belfast, one man was treated for coronavirus symptoms and all the patients had been to Wuhan in China, where the outbreak began.
Professor Paul Cosford, Medicial Director at Public Health England, said: “ These are early days yet with this virus. The vast majority of people who are infected do seem to be getting better.
`` The people who have done particularly badly, and sadly died, they seem to be people who have other conditions that might make them more likely to suffer badly with this virus. ”
The outbreak began on 12 December, and has been traced to a Wuhan market that sold meat and animals. The disease is thought to come from animal products. Currently known as 2019-nCoV, the virus is understood to be a new strain of coronavirus not previously identified in humans.",tech
853,Yuan Falters as China Battles Wuhan Virus,"By Joanne Chiu
China's currency weakened ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday, as the widening spread of the Wuhan coronavirus fanned worries of a deeper economic slowdown in parts of the country.
The yuan traded at 6.9251 against the U.S. dollar in offshore trading midday Friday, a two-week low. Onshore, the currency fell more than 1% this week before Chinese markets closed Jan 24 for a weeklong holiday.
The currency's slide has erased recent gains it chalked up after the U.S. in mid-January removed China from a list of trading partners it considers currency manipulators. The signing of a first-stage trade deal between Beijing and Washington had also helped buoy the yuan.
China this week reported sharp increases in the number of people sickened by a pneumonia-causing virus that was first identified in the central city of Wuhan in December. The government has imposed lockdowns on three major cities, stopping flights and shutting public transportation systems to curb the spread of the coronavirus, which has infected more than 800 people and killed 25.
The country was already contending with slower economic growth prior to the outbreak, and the yuan could come under more pressure if the viral outbreak worsens and crimps consumer spending, travel and business activity, strategists say. Already, many Chinese citizens have canceled or modified their travel plans during what is traditionally the country's busiest travel season.
`` The bad news is that the worst has yet to come, as the number of new infections is still on the rise, '' said Larry Hu, chief China economist at Macquarie Capital Ltd.
Ken Cheung, chief Asian foreign-exchange strategist at Mizuho Bank in Hong Kong, said some investors who profited from the yuan's recent climb have closed out their positions ahead of the Lunar New Year break. `` They're wary of an escalation of confirmed cases after the holiday, '' he said.
Mr. Cheung said he expects the yuan to trade around 6.9 to the dollar as the market assesses the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on China's growth outlook and consumption patterns.
Back in 2003, the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome -- caused by a similar but more deadly virus -- initially caused China's economic growth to slow, but the economy rebounded quickly later in the year after the disease's spread was brought under control. SARS ended up killing 774 people world-wide and infecting more than 8,000 people, mostly in China.
Last August, Beijing let the yuan weaken beyond 7 per dollar for the first time in more than a decade, during a time of heightened trade tensions. The Chinese currency touched a low of nearly 7.2 in early September and has broadly strengthened since. The country last week reported GDP growth of 6.1% for 2019, its slowest growth rate in decades but within a range it earlier forecast.

868,European Stocks Surge as World Health Organization Calms China Virus Fears,"European stocks rebounded sharply on Friday as the World Health Organization eased concerns over the coronavirus crisis in China.
The Stoxx 600 climbed 1.2% in early trading, while the German DAX and the French CAC rose 1.3%, having dropped on Thursday amid concerns over the spreading virus. The FTSE 100 climbed 1.6%.
The continent’ s major indexes rebounded on Friday despite the coronavirus death toll rising to 26 people. The World Health Organization’ s decision not to declare the outbreak a public health emergency appears to have improved sentiment among investors. China has also imposed travel restrictions on a ninth city in a bid to contain the virus.
European stocks slipped on Thursday over the coronavirus crisis and as investors moved away from riskier assets. U.S. President Donald Trump added to the negative sentiment by threatening “ very high tariffs ” in a trade deal with the European Union.
Aside from the improved sentiment regarding the coronavirus, economic data provided a further boost to stocks.
Germany’ s purchasing managers’ index ( PMI) data suggested the country’ s economy, which recorded its weakest growth last year since 2013, picked up at the beginning of 2020.
The manufacturing and services sectors both beat expectations, with the composite PMI rising to 51.1 in January from 50.2 in December.
“ A number of positive takeaways from January’ s flash PMI survey suggest the storm clouds over the German economy may be starting to clear, ” said Phil Smith, principal economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the data.
The Eurozone PMI survey revealed a slower start to the year for the bloc’ s economy, with growth ticking along at the same pace as in December. Manufacturing PMI moved to five-month highs and closer to stabilizing, but the sector contracted for a 12th consecutive month.
The U.K. economy returned to growth as its composite PMI climbed to 52.4, up from 49.3 in December.

916,China Eastern Airlines: Coronavirus death toll rises to 41 as China scrambles to contain outbreak,"( Update 1, adds details)
Beijing, Jan 25 ( EFE).- At least 16 more people were confirmed dead on Saturday from a deadly new coronavirus, taking the death toll to 41 in China as the country grapples to contain the outbreak that has so far infected nearly 1,300 people.
The National Health Commission said 444 fresh cases were reported since Friday, raising the number to 1,287 of confirmed patients.
The health commission said that 237 patients were serious while 38 had been cured and discharged from hospitals.
Health authorities have carried out checkups on 15,197 people who have come into close contact with infected persons. Nearly 14,000 of them continue to be monitored for any symptom.
Outside China, five infected persons were reported in Thailand with two of the patients cured, three each in Taiwan, Singapore and France and two each in Japan ( one cured), South Korea, the United States, and Vietnam. One case has been reported in Nepal.
The symptoms of the new coronavirus, provisionally designated by the World Health Organization as 2019-nCoV, are similar to those of cold but may be accompanied by fever and fatigue, dry cough and dyspnea ( shortness of breath).
The WHO has so far decided not to declare an international health emergency due to strict measures carried out in China, which include complete suspension of transport in around a dozen cities in Hubei province and canceling Chinese New Year celebrations.
Traditional events at Lama Temple and Ditan Park in Beijing were canceled due to the risk of spreading the virus, authorities reported Friday, while the famous Forbidden City has also been closed indefinitely.
China has deployed around 600 personnel, including doctors and other health professions, to Wuhan to help fight the disease.
China Eastern airlines flight MU5000 landed in Wuhan at 1.26 am on Saturday carrying 136 medical professionals from 30 hospitals in Shanghai, official daily Global Times reported.
Another report in state news agency Xinhua said that the authorities had sent 450 military health professionals to Wuhan, including some who had experience of fighting the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, ( SARS) caused by a similar virus, and Ebola.
These 450 medical professionals are from different medical colleges of the army, navy and air force and arrived in Wuhan on Friday night in military planes.
The group includes experts in respiratory health, contagious diseases, infection control and intensive care, and would be deployed in Wuhan hospitals where the majority of the coronavirus patients are admitted.
Wuhan, the capital of Hubei, where the virus was first reported, has been on lockdown since Thursday to prevent further spread of the virus and the city's authorities have begun to build a `` special hospital '' with 1,000 beds for infected patients.
`` Construction of the special hospital with a capacity of 1,000 beds for patients with # nCoV2019 has begun in Wuhan, '' official China Daily said on Twitter, which is blocked in the country.
The hospital in Wuhan will be based on the model of a similar facility that was built in just seven days in Beijing to deal with SARS in 2003. EFE

936,Davos 2020: Greta Thunberg vs Mnuchin; Coronavirus fears; Soros's $ 1bn university - Day Three as it happened,"Rolling coverage of the third day of the World Economic Forum in Davos
Graeme Wearden
Fri 24 Jan 2020 07.40 GMT First published on Thu 23 Jan 2020 07.31 GMT
7.40am GMT 07:40
Finally, here’ s our news story on George Soros’ s new initiative:
8.48pm GMT 20:48
The key points:
George Soros at # Davos: “ President trump is a conman and the ultimate narcissist who wants the world to revolve around him. His narcissism has approached a pathological level. His narcissism has become a malignant… https: //t.co/T3HEPK8hUz
George Soros just pledged a billion dollars - a major chunk of his fortune - to create a university network for the politically persecuted. The Open Society University Network ( OSUN). “ The most important & enduring project of my life & I’ d like to see it while I’ m still around ”
George Soros: “ Facebook basically only has one guiding principle: Maximise your profits, irrespective of what harm it will do to the world. ” “ Facebook will work to re-elect Trump and Trump will protect Facebook. ”
8.32pm GMT 20:32
George Soros is also stingingly critical of Facebook, saying the social network has not improved its behaviour.
He suggests it will now work to ensure Donald Trump is re-elected in November.
8.28pm GMT 20:28
George Soros has outlined plans for a new higher education network, to promote his vision of an open society against the likes of populist politicals.
The initiative is called “ The Open Society University Network ”, and is being endowed with $ 1bn from the billionaire philanthropist.
Soros tells his audience in Davos tonight that it will be an international platform for teaching and research, offering classes, and aiming to reach places in need of high quality education.
That could include refugees, the Roma people and other displaced people, he adds.
It sounds like a successor to his Central European University, which Soros founded in Hungary - it fled to Vienna after falling foul of prime minister Victor Orbán.
Soros says he will provide $ 1bn funding to get it going, but is calling on other philanthropists to help too.
Soros, who turns 90 in August, says that he considers OSUM to be the most important and enduring project of his life, adding:
I hope to see it implemented when I’ m still around.
7.55pm GMT 19:55
Soros is also concerned about President Xi, and his attempts to control Chinese society.
With the climate crisis a growing threat too, 2020 and next few years, may determine the fate of both Xi and Trump and the whole world, he adds.
7.51pm GMT 19:51
George Soros says there is now a torrent of protests from people around the world against closed societies.
The biggest is Hong Kong, he says, which “ may well destroy the city’ s economic prosperity. ”
7.49pm GMT 19:49
Onto economics and markets.... Soros warns that Trump has pumped up an already overheated economy through tax cuts.
That’ s why the markets have risen so high — high enough to guarantee Trump’ s re-election, Soros says, except there’ s still 10 months to go.
Plenty of time for things to change, in a revolutionary time
7.47pm GMT 19:47
George Soros now turns his guns on Donald Trump, saying that the US president’ s “ impetuous actions have heightened the risk of a conflict in thei Middle East ” ( he’ s thinking of the asssasination of Qasem Soleiman)
Then he really wades in:
Trump is a con man and the ultimate narcissist who wants the world to revolve around him.
When his dream of the presidency came true, his narcissism took on a pathalogical dimension, Soros continues.
And it’ s now become a malignant disease, because Trump has build a following who believe him.
7.42pm GMT 19:42
Soros then gives a searing assessment of the global situation.
The strongest powers - the U S, China and Russia - have all ended up in the hands of would-be or actual dictators.
And the battle against Brexit, which will be bad for the UK and the EU, ended in “ a crushing defeat ”, Soros adds.
He also criticises India’ s Modi for trying to create a Hindu state.
7.38pm GMT 19:38
Hello again. George Soros, the billionaire philanthropist is speaking at an event in Davos now.
He starts by warning that open societies ( Soros’ s big cause) is under threat, and Climate crisis is threatening our civilisation.
It is easier to influence events than understand what’ s going on, he warns.
This is leading to widespread unhappiness in the population, which populists have taken advantage of, he says.
4.54pm GMT 16:54
Here’ s a summary of the key points from another busy day here in Davos.
Greta Thunberg has hit back at criticism from US treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin, as the climate emergency continues to dominate the World Economic Forum.

943,The Observer view on the coronavirus outbreak,"The world’ s most populous country yesterday celebrated the lunar new year, usually a time of family reunion and joyful celebration. For many Chinese people who have moved away from their place of birth, it is the one time of year they get to visit their familiesThis year the coronavirus outbreak has profoundly muted the celebrations in China, with several cities in lockdown, the imposition of quarantine measures unprecedented in their scale, and many citizens anxious about their own health and that of their families.
The Chinese have borne the brunt of the outbreak so far: coronavirus is known to have killed more than 40 people, and infected another 1,300. But the first cases have already been recorded in the US, Australia, and – on Friday – in Europe.
Like Sars ( severe acute respiratory syndrome, also a coronavirus), bird flu and Ebola, this coronavirus is a zoonotic virus, transferred from animals to humans. In this case, scientists think it is likely to have come from bats or snakes in a live food market in the Chinese city of Wuhan. It is not yet known how infectious it is, and there are fears that it could yet lead to a global pandemic. Although its symptoms currently appear to be less severe than Sars, it may mutate.
China’ s response stands in stark contrast to the Sars outbreak in 2002-2003, and has won it international plaudits. In 2002, China tried to cover up the spread of Sars: newspapers were forbidden from reporting it, public health officials told citizens there was nothing to worry about, and little was done to stop the deadly virus spreading across China.
This time the authorities have been more open: they promptly informed the World Health Organization, shared the virus’ s genetic sequence with the rest of the world and imposed strict travel restrictions and quarantine conditions affecting more than 50 million people. There are, however, concerns that the unprecedented scale of this quarantine – only possible because of the authoritarianism of the Chinese government – could risk counterproductive levels of anxiety and panic. Outside China, the global response has also been reassuring in the main. There is no cure for this particular virus, but work is under way to develop a vaccine.
What this outbreak does reveal, however, is a global failure to take action to minimise the risk of zoonotic viruses jumping species from animals to humans. We are relatively fortunate that, so far, this virus is not as deadly as Sars or Ebola. But there is a very real risk of this happening again.
Eating or transporting and trading wildlife is associated with a heightened risk of these viruses transferring to humans. In some areas, abject poverty pushes people to consume bush meat; Ebola is thought to have originated in wild bats that were killed for food, and in China and other parts of south-east Asia, eating wildlife is considered to be a symbol of wealth and social status, and beneficial to human health. The risk here lies in “ wet markets ” where live and dead animals are in close proximity. The markets continue to exist because of consumer preference: some older people in China, who grew up without refrigerators, are more comfortable buying meat from animals that are freshly slaughtered.
But they provide ideal conditions for new and dangerous viruses to emerge. The Chinese authorities did try to clamp down in the immediate wake of the Sars outbreak, but many markets continue to flourish.
From the spread of zoonotic viruses to the growing threat of antibiotic resistance and the climate crisis, the most existential challenges we face are truly global. They make a mockery of outdated notions of national sovereignty; the idea that so long as we exert control within our tiny corner of the world, everything will be fine. Global challenges like these will test to destruction the ability of transnational institutions such as the WHO, the EU and the World Trade Organization to chivvy along global coordination. They serve as a grave warning to those who would bury their heads in isolationism.",general
947,"China says Wuhan virus, unlike SARS, infectious during incubation — Quartz","The Chinese government warned today ( Jan. 26) the new coronavirus spreading through the country appears to be contagious as much as two weeks before symptoms appear. In a press briefing, the head of China’ s National Health Commission, Ma Xiaowei, said scientists’ understanding of the virus was still “ limited ” and the outbreak was likely to continue for “ some time, ” according to the South China Morning Post.
Most of the patients originally diagnosed with the virus were exposed at the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan, which also trades in wild animals believed to be the source of the infection. Genetic analysis suggests the new coronavirus originated in fruit bats, according to China’ s Centre for Disease Control and Prevention. That gives it a common ancestor with the SARS ( severe acute respiratory syndrome) virus. The SARS outbreak in 2002-03 infected thousands and killed more than 740 people around the world. While people infected with SARs generally developed symptoms within a week of infection, Ma warned that people with the new coronavirus could be contagious for as many as 14 days before showing signs of infection.
Globally, around 2,000 cases, and 56 deaths, have been reported, the vast majority in China. While the virus now appears to be spreading efficiently between humans, health officials in the United States caution that casual contact with an infected person posted a “ minimal risk for developing infection. ”
Wuhan, a city in central China, is at the center of the outbreak. The local government described the new virus as “ preventable and controllable ” at the beginning of the outbreak, but the Chinese government has since quarantined the city of 11 million people, and banned travel from at least a dozen more, an unprecedented move. It is dispatching more than 2,300 medical professionals to battle the outbreak. But experts said China’ s quarantines would have been far more effective if they had acted earlier.
So far, the virus has spread to several provinces in China, with a few reported cases in China, Thailand, Japan, South Korea, and the US. The first case was detected as early as Dec. 1, about three weeks before the Wuhan government’ s announcement of a cluster of pneumonia-like infection on Dec 31. Of the 41 original patients with the virus, most recovered but six have died, according to an analysis by The Lancet. Among the original patients, a median of eight days passed between the onset of symptoms and respiratory distress ( dysponea). All patients developed pneumonia.",tech
949,Canada identifies first case of coronavirus,"Canada on Saturday declared the first “ presumptive ” confirmed case of the deadly coronavirus in a resident who had returned from the central Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak of the viral disease.
Ontario health officials told a news conference the patient is a male in his 50s, who arrived in Toronto on Jan. 22 and was hospitalized the next day after developing symptoms of respiratory illness.
Barbara Yaffe, Ontario’ s associate chief medical officer of health, told reporters that the man is being treated in a public hospital and is in a stable condition.
Ontario health officials are investigating the details of the man’ s contact with others since arriving in Toronto. Early indications are that he took private transportation home after arriving at Toronto airport and then paramedics brought him to the hospital, they added.
The health officials said it is a relatively small family situation, though they declined to give a number, and there is very little by way of contact. They said his family members have been put into self isolation.
Officials said the results from the provincial laboratory confirming the positive case arrived earlier on Saturday. Once the results from the local laboratory are confirmed by Canada’ s National Microbiology Laboratory, the case will be declared the country’ s first confirmed case of coronavirus.
Canada is on high alert to prevent the spread of coronavirus and avoid the repeat of SARS, or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, that killed 44 people in Canada, the only country outside Asia to report deaths from that virus in 2002-2003. Government health officials say Canada is better prepared this time.
The deadly coronavirus has infected more than 1,975 people and killed at least 56 in China. The virus has spread to several countries including the United States, Thailand, South Korea, Japan, Australia and France.

THE CHEAT SHEETFashion's Growing Investment In Chinese New YearGucci Chinese New Year 2020 Campaign | Source: CourtesyChinese New Year, on Jan. 25, marked the start of a week-long holiday in China, with hundreds of millions of people taking to the roads, rails and skies Brands such as Alexander Wang, Uniqlo and Gucci have released Lunar New Year merchandise, with the number of themed items up 45 percent over last year, according to Edited A new coronavirus is spreading fast; tens of millions of Chinese citizens in the worst-affected region are restricted from traveling Fashion brands increasingly go all-out for the Lunar New Year, counting on big spending both in China and the West over the holiday, which started on Jan. 25 but extends through this week in China. The Year of the Rat provides a bigger-than-usual opportunity, allowing for easy Mickey Mouse tie-ins that conveniently appeal both to Chinese tourists and Western audiences. Gucci is partnering with Chinese influencers and celebrities to promote bags featuring the world's most famous rodent. Uniqlo and many, many other more-affordable brands have mouse and rat-themed capsule collections of their own. The question now is whether that spending will materialise. The rapidly spreading coronavirus, which had infected hundreds, has cast a pall over the upcoming holiday. China's government has placed travel restrictions on cities at the centre of the outbreak, limiting mobility for up to 35 million people. Many others may choose to avoid public places, including shopping malls and luxury boutiques. The Bottom Line: It's early days, but the outbreak is already drawing comparisons to SARS, which resulted in the death of hundreds in 2003. That virus’ economic impact was short-lived, though at the time China didn't play as big a role in the global economy, and certainly wasn't the principal driver of growth for fashion and beauty brands that it is today.

Expect none of that talk when LVMH updates investors with its fourth-quarter results on Tuesday; the company is so big, and its success so consistent, that it rarely needs to acknowledge the competition these days. Instead, look for clues about its plans for Tiffany. Many assume LVMH will apply its historic strengths in marketing and in-store experience to the US brand, which could use help on both fronts. The Bottom Line: LVMH’ s eternal optimism about its sales in Asia will be tested by the coronavirus and continued turmoil in Hong Kong. Louis Vuitton was one of the first global brands to close a Hong Kong store since protests began last year, effectively an admission that the city's retail sales are unlikely to bounce back anytime soon.
